# Field Methods in Plant Photobiology: From Principles to Practice

This repository contains the Quarto source files of a future handbook of methods. The `.qmd` files are the sources for Quarto encoded in an extended version of markdown. R code chunks and inline code are used. At the momenmt the project is setup using RStudio desktop. `.yml` files contain metadata settings and `.bib` files the bibliographic information for cited works.

This is work in progress towards a second edition of the handbook _Beyond the Visible_ (under a new title).

The first edition is available open-access under [doi:10.31885/9789521083631](http://doi.org/10.31885/9789521083631).
