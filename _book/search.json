    "text": "4.1 Research on plant responses to ultraviolet radiation (2012)\nPlants are exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation in their natural habitats. The amount and quality of radiation they are exposed to depends on the time of the year, the latitude, the elevation, position in the canopy, clouds and aerosols, and for aquatic plants the depth, solutes and particles contained in the water [see #sec-solar-radiation and #sec-UV-aquatic]. Ultraviolet radiation is consequently a carrier of information about the environment of plants. However, when exposed to enhanced doses of radiation or radiation of short wavelengths, plants can be damaged. When exposed to small doses of radiation plants respond by a mechanism involving the perception of the radiation through a photoreceptor called UVR8 (Jenkins 2009; Rizzini et al. 2011; M. Wu et al. 2011; John M. Christie et al. 2012; D. Wu et al. 2012; Heijde and Ulm 2012). This protein behaves as a pigment at the top of a transduction chain that regulates gene expression. Several genes have been identified as regulated by radiation perceived through UVR8. Some are related to the metabolism of phenolic compounds and are involved in the accumulation of these metabolites.[^1] However, these are not the only genes regulated by UVR8. Genes related to hormone metabolism are also affected, and this could be one of the mechanisms for photomorphogenesis by radiation, for example an increase in leaf thickness or reduction in height of plants. Morphological effects of mediated by UVR8 have been described (Wargent et al. 2009).\nThe irradiance of in sunlight is larger than the irradiance of and plants also have photoreceptors that absorb both radiation and blue light. The best studied of these photoreceptors are cryptochromes and phototropins. Cryptochromes are involved in many photomorphogenic responses, including the accumulation of pigments. Phototropins are well known for their role in plant movements such as stomatal opening in blue light and the movement of chloroplasts (see John M. Christie 2007; Shimazaki et al. 2007; Möglich et al. 2010 for recent reviews).\nThe balance between the different wavebands, , and (photosynthetically active radiation, 400–700 nm), has a big influence on the effect of radiation on plants. Unrealistically low levels of radiation and enhance the effects of (e.g. Caldwell, Flint, and Searles 1994). One reason for this is that radiation is required for photoreactivation, the repair of DNA damage in the light.\nFrom the 1970’s until the 1990’s the main interest in research on the effects of on plants and other organisms was generated by the increase in ambient exposure caused by ozone depletion in the stratosphere (e.g., Caldwell 1971; Caldwell, Teramura, and Tevini 1989; Tevini 1993; Caldwell and Flint 1994). This led to many studies on the effects of increased radiation, both outdoors, in greenhouses and in controlled environments. Frequently the results obtained in outdoor experiments differed from those obtained indoors. This lead to the realization that it is important to use realistic experimental conditions with respect to radiation and its ratio compared to other bands of the solar spectrum. Interactions of responses to radiation with other environmental factors like availability of mineral nutrients, water and temperature, were also uncovered. Effects on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems of ozone depletion, and the concomitant increase in radiation, have been periodically reviewed in UNEP (2011, and earlier reports). These reports include chapters on terrestrial ecosystems (Ballaré et al. 2011) and aquatic ecosystems (Häder et al. 2011).\nFrom the 1990’s onwards, the interest in the study of the effects of normal (i.e., without stratospheric ozone depletion), as opposed to enhanced radiation increased markedly (e.g., N. Paul 2001; P. J. Aphalo 2003; Jansen and Bornman 2012). This was in part due to the realization that even low exposures elicit plant responses, and that these are important for the acclimation of plants to their normal growth environment. Furthermore, as these effects were characterized, interest developed in their possible applications in agriculture and especially horticulture (e.g., N. D. Paul et al. 2005).\nA further subject of current interest is the enhanced release of greenhouse gases from green and dead biomass caused by action of radiation on pectins (e.g., Messenger, McLeod, and Fry 2009; Bloom et al. 2010). Another long-standing subject of research are the direct and indirect effects of solar radiation on litter decomposition (e.g., Newsham et al. 1997, 2001; Austin and Ballaré 2010).\nTo be able to obtain reliable results from experiments on the effects of radiation on plants, there are many different problems that need to be addressed. This requires background knowledge of both photobiology, radiation physics, and climatology.",

    "section": "4.2 Progress in research and new perspective (2024)",
    "text": "4.2 Progress in research and new perspective (2024)\nIn addition to the role of blue light in the photorepair of DNA damage mentioned above, blue light is now known to play additional roles in UV tolerance through the activation of photoreceptors. Molecular studies have revealed a very complex signalling network downstream of plant photoreceptors, that create crosstalk leading complex interactions among the responses to different wavelengths. Time and timing plays a more important role in responses to UV radiation than what was thought 12 years. Nowadays, more emphasis is put on the role of UV radiation as a regulator of plants’ structure and function than as a cause damage to plants, but which effect predominates is dose, timing and genotype dependent. Our perspective has changed in several respects as summarised below.\nIndividual photoreceptors can have multiple modes of action (J. J. Casal, Sánchez, and Botto 1998; Podolec, Demarsy, and Ulm 2021) and the activity of one photorepector may down regulate, up regulate or inhibit the perception of cues by a different photoreceptor (Jorge J. Casal 2009; Zhao et al. 2023). Responses to UV radiation depend on the current and past spectrum and irradiance of visible and near infrared radiation that plants are exposed to (Yan et al. 2020; Rai, Morales, and Aphalo 2021). UVR8 and cryptochrome photoreceptors reciprocally modulate their activity at the signalling level through COP1 and BES mediated interactions (Rai et al. 2019, 2020; Tissot and Ulm 2020; Podolec, Demarsy, and Ulm 2021). Further downstream, HY5 and PIFs mediated signalling depends on these two photoreceptors but also on the phytochromes (Sellaro202x?) and phototropins (Vandenbussche et al. 2014). A recent proposal is that the multiple roles played by photoreceptors sharing signalling network components are made possible by compartimentalization into distinct tissues and cell-types (Depaepe, Vanhaelewyn, and Van Der Straeten 2023).\nFurthermore, CRYs and PHYs, control responses affecting optical properties and display of leaves, that could modify the sensitivity to UV radiation by attenuating it or reducing its interception (Rai, Morales, and Aphalo 2021). The optical properties of the epidermis vary during the course of the day and in response to exposure to blue light and UV radiation (Barnes et al. 2015) and also seasonally (Solanki et al. 2019). Even changes in optical properties of single stranded DNA in chloroplasts can affect sensitivity to damage by UV-B exposure (Saeid Nia et al. 2023). Thus, current understanding of plant responses to UV, VIS and NIR radiation indicates that a broader perspective is needed in the study of plants’ responses sunlight and shadelight at multiple time scales (Barnes 2017; Barnes et al. 2018; Robson et al. 2019).\nIn sunlight, because of the shape of the solar spectrum, UVR8 “the UV-B photoreceptor” mediates responses to both UV-B and UV-A2 radiation, while CRYs are more responsive to solar blue light than to UV-A1 radiation (Rai, Morales, and Aphalo 2021). That responses to UV-A1 and UV-A2 radiation are mediated by different photoreceptors and very distinct, introduces the need to differentiate between UV-A1 and UV-A2 in controlled environments (Rai, Morales, and Aphalo 2021). In the case of some responses UVR8- and CRY-dependent responses complement each other, and a strong phenotype is observed only when both photoreceptors are inactive (Rai et al. 2020; Tissot and Ulm 2020).\nBoth selection and acclimation are crucial to fitness of wild plants and yield of crops (Pedro J. Aphalo and Sadras 2022). Acclimation implies that the previously experienced environment affects later responses, and this is not constrained to the same cue or variable, as environmental correlations in the natural environment are exploited by plants and other organisms as sources of information (Pedro J. Aphalo and Sadras 2022). Thus, time is important with respect to the developmental stage and previous “experience” (a life-time memory) (Rai et al. 2019) and, in some cases at least, previous generations’ “experience” (maternal effects) (Yan et al. 2020).\nAcclimation of stomatal responses in response to exposure to UV radiation (Ač et al. 2024) and of photosynthesis to high versus low light levels (Brelsford et al. 2018), can be relevant to drought tolerance (Jansen et al. 2021; Pedro J. Aphalo and Sadras 2022) and also involves the participation of photoreceptors, sensing UV radiation. In the case of stomata, acclimation can involve chnages in opening speed as well as in relative sensitivity to radiation of different wavelengths (Aasamaa and Aphalo 2017).\nThe importance of photoperiodism in some plants’ responses has been recognised for a long time. However, recent progress has shown that not only photoperiodic, stomatal and photosynthesis responses but also photomorphogenic responses depend on the time of day (Sellaro202x?). The daily time course of UVR8 dimerization state (Liao et al. 2020) and the seasonality of responses mediated by UVR8 are also two important aspects of timing (Coffey and Jansen 2018).\nTemporal (from seasonal to milliseconds) and spatial heterogeinity in the light environment of plants are an ever present feature outdoors (Hartikainen et al. 2020; Kotilainen et al. 2020; Durand and Robson 2023). Furthermore, even if in its infancy, the study of responses to pulsed light has shown that photoreceptor-dependent responses are not proportional to the average light conditions during the photoperiod, but instead, temporal integration of cues is far more complex and can involve multiple photoreceptors, including UVR8, and PHYs (Sellaro202x?).\nSomething about applications in horticulture could be added here.\nTo study plant responses to UV radiation, consideration of the whole daylight spectrum as well as of the life history of the plants is necessary. It is also necessary to keep in mind relevance to agriculture (Sadras et al. 2021), biological resilience (Thorogood et al. 2023) and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\nTwelve years ago, it was already recognised that the balance between UV-B radiation and longer wavelengths and the timing of UV-B exposure at noon were needed for relevance of research to plants growing in sunlight. Research in the last 12 years has revealed a very complex molecular signalling mechanism, making it important also for mechanistic studies in controlled environments to be aware of VIS and NIR radiation and the corresponding photoreceptors. This is reflected in that several currently active research groups have already bridged the artificial divide between UV plant photobiology and the rest of plant photobiology.",

    "text": "5.1 Introduction\nMost if not all organisms are in a way or another directly dependent on light (L. O. Björn 2015). For humans and most animals, vision is necessary for navigation and communication. Body colour can both enhance visibility and serve as camouflage. For photoautotrophs like plants, light is a source of energy for growth when captured through photosynthesis, but also when sensed through photoreceptors, a source of information. Flower colours and visual patterns are a means of light-mediated communication (Figure 5.1).\nAs a source of energy, short wavelength radiation, if in excess, can damage unprotected tissues through uncontrolled photochemical reactions, i.e., by UV-B exposure breaking bonds in molecules (e.g., Rousseaux et al. 1999). However, these short wavelengths together with longer wavelengths make organisms and objects warmer when they are absorbed. Thus, radiation-driven overheating can also damage tissues and cause the death of organisms, including plants (e.g., xxxxx?).\nDepending on the intensity and timing, radiation of any wavelength from UV-B to thermal infrared can be damaging or beneficial to organisms, including plants. For a given exposure to radiation, the optical properties of vegetation, plants, individual organs such as leaves, tissues, cells and even organelles modulate the fate of the incident energy: radiation that is not absorbed or that is safely dissipated after absorption does not cause damage. White reflective waxes, pubescence, paraheliotropy, and chloroplast accumulation decrease radiation absorption (Figure 5.2), while screening pigments in the epidermis, transpiration, and small-sized leaves contribute to safe dissipation of energy. For radiation that reaches into chloroplasts, biochemical mechanisms for the dissipation have evolved, such as carotenoid cycling.\nSensing of light through photoreceptors as well as its conversion into chemical energy by photosynthesis, start at a photochemical reaction where one (or occasionally two or more) photons transfer energy to a pigment molecule to excite it (Figure 5.3). Quantum physics helps explain phenomena observable at larger scales, such as action spectra for whole-plant responses.\nFigure 5.3: Range of wavelengths sensed through different higher-plant photoreceptor families or able to drive photosynthesis. A: photosynthesis, CRY: criptochromes 1 and 2, PHOT: phototropins 1 and 2, ZTL: Zeitloupe, UVR8: “UV-B” photoreceptor, PHY: phytochromes A/B/C/D/E. A dark wide bar indicates wavelengths of high and well demonstrated activity and narrower lighter coloured bars wavelengths for which activity is less important or uncertain. The vertical dashed line indicates the shortest wavelength in sunlight at ground level.\nIn addition to plant’s optical properties, in photobiology research, optics and radiation physics play a crucial role in the design of experiments and reporting of treatment conditions. For example, when studying photosynthesis using chlorophyll fluorescence, the correct interpretation of the measured yield must be based on the absorbed photons, not the incident ones. Radiation needs to be quantified in a way relevant to the object of study. The optical properties of experimental set-ups, need to be adjusted to the aims of each experiment and, crucially, have to be accurately described. This makes it necessary for those doing research in photobiology to have a good command of how UV, visible and infrared radiation interact with different objects and organisms. The aim of this chapter is to provide such a foundation as support for later chapters in the book.",

    "section": "5.2 Wavelength and Colour",
    "text": "5.2 Wavelength and Colour\nRadiation, or radiant energy, can be described as waves, with wavelength or frequency as properties, or based on quantum physics, as photons of specific energy. This “double personality” of light is important as each approach provides a simpler explanation than the other one for different specific phenomena, such as refraction and reflection at boundaries between materials and absorption of radiation by pigments and other molecules. From the first perspective, ultraviolet (UV), visible (VIS), and infrared (IR) radiation are electromagnetic waves and are described by the Maxwell’s equations.1 From the second perspective, Plank’s law describes the energy of a quantum as inversely proportional to wavelength.\nThe wavelength ranges of visible radiation, described by their colour based on human vision’s response to monochromatic light, are shown in Figure 5.4, topmost bar of wavebands. The colour ranges indicated in Figure 5.4 are one approximation out of several available. We follow the ISO and CIE standards when applicable. The electromagnetic spectrum is continuous with no clear boundaries between one colour and the next. Colours are the result of the interaction of different wavelengths of radiation with the photoreceptor pigments in the eye and the processing of the stimuli by the brain. Alternative definitions based on other sensory systems or energy capture systems are available, some of them applicable to plants are shown in Figure 5.4, two lowermost bars of wavebands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: The solar spectrum, \\(280-900\\,\\mathrm{nm}\\), and different commonly used named wavebands. The solar spectrum at ground level for 1.5 air masses (ASTM G173 standard) and, from top to bottom, human-vision colours according to ISO 21348, UV and IR bands according to ISO 21348, UV and IR bands according to CIE, colours as frequently defined in plant photobiology (Sellaro et al. 2010; Smith 1981), and PAR (McCree 1972).\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent regions or wavebands of UV and IR radiation are also shown in Figure 5.4, but only in the proximity of visible radiation. In Figure 5.5 they are shown for a wider range of wavelengths. It is important to keep in mind that the ISO and CIE definitions of the VIS and UV wavebands overlap. Thus, it is incorrect to sum VIS and UV irradiances, while the definitions of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and UV do not overlap. Especially in the IR region, the subdivision is somewhat arbitrary and the boundaries used in the literature vary, with differences even between ISO and CIE standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: The solar spectrum, \\(250-3000\\,\\mathrm{nm}\\), and different commonly used named wavebands. The solar spectrum at ground level for 1.5 air masses (ASTM G173 standard) and, from top to bottom, visible light according to ISO 21348 and CIE, UV and IR bands according to ISO 21348, UV and IR bands according to CIE, PAR (McCree 1972) and ePAR (Zhen, Iersel, and Bugbee 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe energy of a quantum of radiation in a vacuum, depends on the wavelength, \\(\\lambda\\), or frequency2, \\(\\nu\\),\n\\[q = h \\cdot \\nu = h \\cdot \\frac{c}{\\lambda}\\]\nwith the Planck constant \\(h=6.626\\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s}\\) and speed of light in vacuum \\(c=2.998\\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\). When dealing with numbers of photons, the equation above can be extended by using Avogadro’s number \\(N_\\mathrm{A}=6.022\\times 10^{23}\\) mol\\(^{-1}\\). Thus, the energy of one mole of photons, \\(q^\\prime\\), is\n\\[q^\\prime = h^\\prime \\cdot \\nu = h^\\prime \\cdot \\frac{c}{\\lambda}\\] with \\(h'=h\\cdot N_\\mathrm{A}=3.990\\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s\\,mol}^{-1}\\).\nThe two equations above, are valid for all kinds of electromagnetic waves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexamples\n\n\n\nExample 1: red light at 600 nm has about 200 kJ mol\\(^{-1}\\), therefore, 1 \\(\\mu\\)mol photons has 0.2 J.

    "section": "5.3 Angle of Incidence",
    "text": "5.3 Angle of Incidence\nMost frequently we describe the flux of radiation on a plane, usually, but not always a horizontal plane (Figure 5.6). This flux is called irradiance and expressed per unit area and unit time. The area used as a reference is that of the receiving plane. Fluence rate is measured on the surface of a sphere instead of a plane. In this case, the plane is located in three-dimensional (3D) space. When considering a point source of radiation, the angle, \\(\\alpha\\), between the light beam and the receiving plane or surface affects the received irradiance: the shallower the angle of incidence the lower the irradiance from the same beam of light. Both irradiance and fluence rate are fluxes of radiation, expressed per unit area and unit time (Figure 5.6). In the first case the area is that of the illuminated planar surface and in the second case of an spherical surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.6: The concepts of irradiance and fluence rate explained. (A) A beam of radiation perpendicular to the plane of an irradiance sensor; irradiance and fluence rate have the same numerical value. (B) Radiation beam at an angle to the irradiance sensor; irradiance has a smaller numerical value than fluence rate. (C) Perfectly diffuse radiation from the hemisphere above the irradiance sensor; the numerical value of irradiance is one half that of fluence rate. (D) Perfectly diffuse radiation from both hemispheres, both above and below the sensors; the numerical value of irradiance is one quarter that of fluence rate. A spherical sensor (left) measures fluence rate, and a one-sided planar sensor (right) measures irradiance. In (A) and (B) radiation is collimated and represented by parallel arrows. In (C) and (D) radiation is diffuse and represented by “randomly” oriented arrows. In (A), (B) and (C) the shaded hemisphere of the spherical sensor is grey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSensors and their shape\n\n\n\nThere are, in principle, two possible approaches to measuring radiation. The first is to observe light from one specific direction or viewing angle, which is the radiance \\(L\\). The second is to use a detector, which senses radiation from more than one direction and measures radiation impinging it from all directions from an enclosing sphere or hemisphere. The relation between irradiance \\(E\\) and radiance \\(L\\) at wavelength \\(\\lambda\\) is given by integrating incoming photons over these directions.\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nE[0](\\lambda) & = \\int_\\Omega L(\\lambda,\\Omega) {\\rm d}\\Omega \\label{equ_E0} \\\\\nE(\\lambda) & = \\int_\\Omega I(\\lambda,\\Omega) |\\cos\\alpha| {\\rm d}\\Omega \\label{equ_E}\n%\\end{eqnarray}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nThe shape of a detector entrance-optics, planar or spherical, determines the measured physical quantity, and the weight given to photons from different directions (Figure 5.6). Collection of light on a flat surface (or equivalently through an small opening in an integrating sphere) yields irradiance, energy irradiance, \\(E\\), or photon irradiance, \\(Q\\) depending on the spectral response of the detector. A spherical collecting surface, yields fluence rate (also called scalar irradiance) \\(E_0\\), \\(Q_0\\). In practice, all spherical sensors have a blind stop due to necesary support and connection to a readout device.\n\n\nThe sun, can be assumed to be a point source (the solar disk is \\(\\approx 1 ^\\circ\\) in diameter when seen from Earth). Changes in distance that are of interest when studying plants are extremely small relative to the total Sun to Earth distance and can be ignored. Thus, in the case of direct sunlight, we have to consider only the angle of incidence. For a given light source the maximum irradiance is that received on a plane normal to the light beam (Figure 5.6). As the angle between the beam and the surface becomes shallower, the irradiance measured on the plane decreases, reaching zero, when the beam is parallel to the surface. The relationship between the normal area and that at a shallower angle is given by the cosine of the angle \\(\\alpha\\). When considering the sun, if the receiving plane is horizontal, the angle of interest is the zenith angle (1 - solar elevation angle) (Figure 5.7). If the plane is not horizontal, the angle between the plane and the light beam depends both the the zenith angle and the azimuth angle of the sun’s position, and the effective angle needs to be computed in three dimensions.\n\n\n\nimage/svg+xml\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZenith    Celestial MeridianSunObserverHorizonNAzimuthElevation\n\n\nFigure 5.7: Asimuth and elevation angles of the sun. If the plane on which irradiance is measured is horizontal, the Azimuth angle does not affect the incident angle, and it is enough to only take into account the elevation angle. Modified from figure by TWCarlson - Azimut altitude.svg, CC BY-SA 3.0 file at wikimedia.org.\n\n\n\nObviously, the discussion above ignored scattered radiation from the sky. One approach to the simulation of the light field when multiple sources or sources with a large emitting area are present, is to use ray tracing, which is essentially a divide and conquer approach.\nWhen we considered a point source like a bare LED chip or light from a small light bulb at a relatively short distance from the receiving plane, distance cannot be ignored as done above for the sun, as the illuminated area increases four times for each doubling in the distance. Thus, each doubling in distance decreases irradiance by 75%.\nIn the case of light sources with a large surface relative to the illuminated area or light beams focused by a lens or reflector, the rate of increase in area is smaller than for a point source. The extreme case is a highly collimated laser beam, for which the illuminated area increases very slowly with increasing distance. The irradiance, in these cases, is frequently not uniform within the illuminated area, with in most cases higher iradiance at the centre than at the edges of the illuminated area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nUsing a lens or reflector to make a light beam narrower makes it possible to increase irradiance by concentrating the light energy onto a smaller illuminated area, and this effect can be quantitatively large. Alternatively, the narrower beam makes it possible to move the light source away from the illuminated object maintaining the same irradiance. This can provide additional space for other equipment, or when using selective reflectors that transmit infrared radiation and only reflect VIS and/or UV radiation reduce the heat load on the illuminated object.\n\n\nIn a perfectly collimated beam, the photons follow parallel trajectories. In a beam from a ideal point source the trajectories of the photons are equally probable in all directions (away from the centre of an imaginary sphere). Most real light sources behave somewhere in between these extremes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAngle of Incidence in 3D\n\n\n\nWhile in Figure 5.7, we had the sensor or observer at the centre, and the light source located on an imaginary sphere, here, instead, we locate the point light source at the centre of the sphere. So, when a beam or the radiation passing into a space or sphere is analysed, two important parameters are necessary: the distance to the source and the position of the measurement plane—i.e., if the receiving surface is perpendicular to the beam or at a shallower angle. The geometry is illustrated in Figure 5.8. The radiation is received at distance \\(r\\) by a surface of area d\\(A\\), tilted by an angle \\(\\alpha\\) to the unit sphere’s surface element, a solid angle, d\\(\\Omega\\), which is a two-dimensional angle in a space. The relation between d\\(A\\) and d\\(\\Omega\\) in spherical coordinates is geometrically explained in Figure 5.8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.8: Definition of the solid angle dΩ and the geometry of areas in the space (redrawn after Eichler et al. 1993), where the given solid angle dΩ remains the same, regardless of distance r , while the exposed area exemplified by dA will change with distance r from the origin (light source) and the angle α, if the exposed area (or detector) is tilted. The angle denoted by φ is the azimuth angle and θ is the zenith angle.\n\n\n\nThe solid angle is calculated from the zenith angle \\(\\theta\\) and azimuth angle \\(\\phi\\), which denote the direction of the radiation beam\n\\[{\\rm d}\\Omega = {\\rm d}\\theta\\cdot\\sin\\theta{\\rm d}\\phi \\label{equ_dsolidangle}\\] The area of the receiving surface is calculated by a combination of the solid angle of the beam, the distance \\(r\\) from the radiation source and the angle \\(\\alpha\\) of the tilt:\n\\[{\\rm d}A  =  \\frac{r{\\rm d}\\theta}{\\cos\\alpha}\\cdot r\\sin\\theta{\\rm d}\\phi\\] which can be rearranged to\n\\[\\Rightarrow {\\rm d}A  =  \\frac{r^2}{\\cos\\alpha}\\quad{\\rm d}\\Omega\\] Thus, the solid angle is given by\n\\[\\Omega = \\int_A \\frac{{\\rm d}A\\cdot\\cos\\alpha}{r^2} \\label{equ_solidangle}\\] The unit of the solid angle is a steradian (sr). The solid angle of an entire sphere is calculated by integration of the equation above over the zenith (\\(\\theta\\)) and azimuth (\\(\\phi\\)) angles, \\(0\\le\\theta\\le\\pi(180^\\circ)\\) and \\(0\\le\\phi\\le2\\pi(360^\\circ)\\), and is \\(4\\pi\\) sr.\n\n\n\n5.3.1 Radiation Quantities\nThe amount of radiation can be quantified in different ways. Each quantity is useful in different circumstances. We have already used some of these quantities above, here we Quantities can describe flows (energy per unit time), flux rates (energy per unit time and unit area), exposure (energy per event and unit area), radiant flux (energy per unit time) and radiance (energy per unit area and solid angle). The shape of the receiving surface can be a plane, a sphere, a hemisphere or even a cylinder. In the case of radiance, the angle of acceptance of the sensor can also vary but is usually narrow (\\(\\leq 10^\\circ\\)). These definitions are independent of wavelengths, but the quantities are in most cases used to describe energy integrated over a certain range of wavelengths based on the “named” wavebands shown in Figure 5.4 and Figure 5.5. The definitions and symbols of several physical quantities used to describe the “amount of radiation” are given in Table 5.1.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.1: Energy based radiation quantities. Commonly used symbols and units in the SI (Systeme Internationale).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nUnit\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\Phi=\\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial t}\\)\nW = J s\\(^{-1}\\)\nRadiant flux: absorbed or emitted energy per time interval\n\n\n\\(H=\\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial A}\\)\nJ m\\(^{-2}\\)\nExposure: energy towards a surface area.

The irradiance decreases by the square of the distance to the source and depends on the tilt of the detecting surface area, \\(\\alpha\\). This is valid only for theretical point sources, and a good approximation for small ones. For outdoor measurements the sun can be assumed to be a point source. For artificial light sources simple LEDs (light-emitting diodes) without optics on top are also effectively point sources. However, LEDs with optics—and other artificial light sources with optics or reflectors designed to give a narrower light beam—deviate to various extents from the rule of a decrease of irradiance proportional to the square of the distance from the light source.\nWhen we are interested in photochemical reactions, the most relevant radiation quantities are those expressed in photons. The reason for this is that, as discussed in ?sec-radiation-photochemistry-principles, molecules are excited by the absorption of certain fixed amounts of energy or quanta. The surplus energy “decays” by non-photochemical processes. When studying photosynthesis, where many photons of different wavelengths are simultaneously important, we normally use photon irradiance to describe amount of . The name photosynthetic photon flux density, or , is also frequently used when referring to photon irradiance. When dealing with energy balance of an object instead of photochemistry, we use (energy) irradiance. In meteorology both and visible radiation, are quantified using energy-based quantities. When dealing with photochemistry as in responses mediated by UVR8, a photoreceptor, the use of quantum quantities is preferred. Photon based radiation quantities are listed in Table 5.2, the symbol \\(Q\\) (“quanta”) is used for photon irradiance.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.2: Photon-based radiation quantities. Commonly used symbols and units in the SI (Systeme Internationale).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nUnit\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\Phi_\\mathrm{p}\\)\ns\\(^{-1}\\)\nPhoton flux: number of photons per time interval\n\n\n\\(Q=\\frac{\\partial \\Phi_\\mathrm{p}}{\\partial A}\\)\nm\\(^{-2}\\) s\\(^{-1}\\)\nPhoton irradiance: photon flux towards a surface area, photon flux density (earlier frequently called photon flux density and abbreviated as PFD)\n\n\n\\(H_p=\\int_t\\;Q\\;\\mathrm{d}t\\)\nm\\(^{-2}\\)\nPhoton exposure: number of photons towards a surface area during a time interval, photon fluence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese quantities can be also used based on a ‘chemical’ amount of moles by dividing the quantities by Avogadro’s number \\(N_A=6.022\\times 10^{23}\\) mol\\(^{-1}\\). To determine a quantity in terms of photons, an energetic quantity has to be weighted by the number of photons, i.e., divided by the energy of a single photon at each wavelength as defined in equation XXXX. This yields, for example, \\[\\Phi_\\mathrm{p} = \\frac{\\lambda}{h\\;c}\\times\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial t}\\hspace{1cm}\\mathrm{and}\\hspace{1cm}Q(\\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda}{h\\;c}\\times E(\\lambda)\\] When dealing with bands of wavelengths, for example an integrated value like from 400 to 700 nm, it is necessary to repeat these calculations at each wavelength and then integrate over the wavelengths. For example, the photon irradiance or in moles of photons is obtained by \\[Q_\\mathrm{PAR} = \\frac{1}{N_\\mathrm{A}}\\int_{400\\;\\mathrm{nm}}^{700\\,\\mathrm{nm}}\\frac{\\lambda}{hc}\\;E(\\lambda)\\;\\mathrm{d}\\lambda\\] For integrated values of or radiation the calculation is done analogously by integrating from 280 to 315 nm or 315 to 400 nm, respectively.\nIf we have measured (energy) irradiance, and want to convert this value to photon irradiance, the exact conversion will be possible only if we have information about the spectral composition of the measured radiation. Conversion factors at different wavelengths are given below in Table 5.3. For “average daylight” in the wavelength band 400 to 700 nm the conversion factor is approximately \\(4.6\\,\\mathrm{\\mu mol\\,J^{-1}}\\). This is exact at a wavelength at 550 nm, and will deviate depending on the shape of the spectrum.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.3: Energy per photon and conversion factors between photon and energy quantities at different wavelengths. The factors assume \\(Q\\) values are expressed as \\(\\mathrm{\\mu mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}\\) and \\(I\\) values as \\(\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}\\).

Although quantitatively irrelevant to systems other that human vision, they are commonly used by lamp manufacturers to describe light output of artificial light sources. Photometric sensors are also the most widely available. Photometric or illumination quantities are expressed in different units than those of physical quantities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotometric quantities\n\n\n\nIn contrast to (spectro-)radiometry, where the energy of any electromagnetic radiation is measured in terms of absolute power (\\(J\\,s^{-1} = W\\)), photometry measures light as perceived by the human eye. Therefore, radiation is weighted by a luminosity function or visual sensitivity function describing the wavelength dependent response of the human eye. Due to the physiology of the eye, having rods and cones as light receptors, different sensitivity functions exist for the day (photopic vision) and night (scotopic vision), \\(V(\\lambda)\\) and \\(V'(\\lambda)\\), respectively (Figure 5.9). The maximum response during the day is at \\(\\lambda=555\\) nm and during night at \\(\\lambda=507\\) nm. Both response functions (normalised to their maximum) are shown in the figure below as established by the Commission Internationale de l’Éclairage (CIE, International Commission on Illumination, Vienna, Austria) in 1924 for photopic vision and 1951 for scotopic vision (Schwiegerling 2004). The data are available from the Colour and Vision Research Laboratory. The photopic response, \\(V(\\lambda)\\), is used as the basis of all photometric measurements. However, for very low irradiance, it is possible to compute similar quantities using the scotopic response \\(V'(\\lambda)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.9: Photopic response of the human eye, \\(V(\\lambda)\\), normalised. This is the 2 degrees curve. The numbers in the colour bar, indicate the relative sensitivity, as a percent, to different colours of light as defined in standard ISO 21348.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: It is important to be aware that these response curves are based on a small number of subjects and, due to variation, not necessarily representative of any individual person, or even of persons of different age or of other ethnicities than those in the study in which the data for the curves were obtained.\nIf we convolute (multiply wavelength by wavelength) the photopic response spectrum with a spectral irradiance we obtain a new curve (Figure 5.10). The area under this curve, multiplies by a constant, is a measure of the perceived brightness of the light by a “typical” human observer, in this case, \\(E_\\mathrm{v} = 103\\,\\mathrm{klx}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.10: Photopic response of the human eye, \\(V(\\lambda)\\) from Figure 5.9 convoluted by the AM1.5 solar spectrum from Figure 5.4. The area under the curve, is a measure of brightness as perceived by a human. The numbers in the colour bar, indicate the relative contribution, as a percent, of different colours of light as defined in standard ISO 21348.\n\n\n\n\n\nCorresponding to the physical quantities of radiation summarized in Table 5.1 above, the equivalent photometric quantities are listed in the Table 5.4 below and have the subscript \\(\\mathrm{v}\\). The ratio between the (physiological) luminous flux \\(\\Phi_\\mathrm{v}\\) and the (physical) radiant flux \\(\\Phi\\) is the (photopic) photometric equivalent \\(K(\\lambda)=V(\\lambda)\\times K_m\\) with \\(K_m=683\\) lm W\\(^{-1}\\) (lumen per watt) at 555 nm. The dark-adapted sensitivity of the eye (scotopic vision) has its maximum at 507 nm with 1700 lm W\\(^{-1}\\). The base unit of luminous intensity is candela (cd). One candela is defined as the monochromatic intensity at 555 nm with \\(I=\\frac{1}{683}\\) W sr\\(^{-1}\\). The luminous flux of a normal candle is around 12 lm. Assuming a homogeneous emission into all directions, the luminous intensity is about \\(I_v=\\frac{12\\;\\mathrm{lm}}{4\\pi\\;\\mathrm{sr}}\\approx 1\\) cd.\n\n\n\nTable 5.4: Photometric quantities.

PAR is expressed in physical units as a flux of photons of wavelengths between 400 and 700 nm. Before its widespread acceptance and the widespread availability of PAR or “quantum” light sensors, both energy and photometric quantities were frequently used in research on plants and vegetation. Very long term series of global radiation are available, while those for PAR are shorter and fewer.\nIn the case of UV radiation, different biologically effective weightings are used, mostly to describe damage or inhibition. These quantities are normally expressed using energy flux units. However, these are weighted values that do not describe an energy flux but instead a value assumed to be proportional to a response such as growth inhibition (thus based on the same approach as used for photometric quantties).\nPhotosynthetically active radiation, Caldwell’s Generalized Plant Damage spectrum or GPAS-based exposures, and several other “effective” quantities are in common use in plant research and plant production. These are described in detail in Chapter XXXXX.",

    "text": "5.4 Interactions of Light with Matter\n\n5.4.1 Reflection\nCollimated light reflected from a mirror surface remains collimated, while its direction changes. Light reflected from a white surface is scattered, and if previously collimated, after being reflected it becomes more diffuse, i.e., it leaves the surface in multiple directions. A black surface does not reflect the incident light, it absorbs it. A clear or transparent object transmits all the light incident on its surface, similarly to reflection from mirrors and white surfaces, a clear object can scatter the light passing through it or not. Real objects share some of the properties of these theoretical objects. For example, the atmosphere is not perfectly clear and does partly scatter and partly absorb radiation, depending on the wavelength of the incoming or outgoing radiation. The same applies to water. In both cases, interactions take place as the light travels through them, as well as at the interface between media with different refractive index.\nSpecular reflection, like in a mirror, affects the angle of the beam consitently, thus, preserving the image. Diffuse reflection consists in scattered light, thus the image is not preserved, light on a white matte wall (Figure 5.11). The sum of specular and diffuse reflection is called total reflection.\n\\[R^\\mathrm{tot} = R^\\mathrm{spcl} + R^\\mathrm{diff}\\]\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n  \n  \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n  specularreflection\n  diffusereflection\n  incident light\n \n\n\n\nFigure 5.11: Specular and diffuse reflection source temporary fill to be replaced by figure redrawn from Gates, D (1980) Figure 8.35.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGloss\n\n\n\nGloss is assessed as specular reflectance. Depending on the type of surface, different angles of incidence for the collimated light beam are used. “Gloss meters” are frequently used in industrial quality control, but have been occasonally used to characterize the surface optical properties of individual plant leaves (add reference).\n\n\nAt the boundary between two materials with different refractive index, the direction of the light beam changes, and depending on the difference in refractive index and the angle of incidence, a varying fraction of the incident light is reflected at the interface (Figure 5.12). On a flat surface like a glass plate or polished metal surface the applicable equation is that derived from Snell’s law, which mathematically is given by\n\\[n_1 \\times sin(\\theta_1) = n_2 \\times sin(\\theta_2)\\]\nwhere \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) are the refractive indexes of two materials, such as air and glass, and \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) and the refraction angles.\nReflectance can be estimated from the difference in refractive index and the angle of incidende of the light onto the plane of the interface. Reflectance depends on the contribution of \\(s\\) and \\(p\\) polarised components.\n\\[R_p = \\left(\\frac{n^2 \\times \\cos(\\theta) - \\sqrt{n^2 - \\sin(\\theta)^2}}\n{n^2 \\times \\cos(\\theta) +\n        \\sqrt{n^2 - \\sin(\\theta)^2}}\\right)^2\\]\nand\n\\[R_s = \\left(\\frac{\\cos(\\theta) - \\sqrt{n^2 - \\sin(\\theta)^2}}\n{\\cos(\\theta) +\n        \\sqrt{n^2 - \\sin(\\theta)^2}}\\right)^2\\]\nCombining both formulas above, weighted based on the contributions of \\(p\\) and \\(s\\) components. The reflectance of a single interface can be calculated as\n\\[R = R_p \\times f_p + R_s \\times f_s\\]\nwith \\(f_p + f_s = 1\\), for the fraction of the radiation with \\(p\\) and \\(s\\) polarization planes. Using these equations, the reflectance at a glass window in contact with air of both sides can be computed. The refractive index of air is 1 and that of glass 1.5, so reflectance for a relative refractive index of \\(n = 1.5\\) is shown in Figure 5.12 simulates a single and a double interface.\nThe reflectance for two surfaces can be computed taking into account multiple back and forth reflections within the glass pane as well as its internal absorbance, or approximated ignoring them, as in Figure 5.12. For a clear glass pane the error is not too large, but for some other materials could cause significant bias in the estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.12: Reflectance of a crown glass or acrylic pane in air as a function of the angle of incidence of light. The dark grey area under the dashed line describes the light reflected by the air to glass (or entrance) interface and the pale grey area describes the light reflected at the glass to air (or exit) interface and the solid line the sum of them. The minimum reflectance at the first interface is 4%. Computed based on a relative refractive index (\\(n\\)) of 1.5, ignoring the higher order reflections of light bouncing back and forth within the glass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractical examples\n\n\n\nThe fraction of the incident light reflected by the glass or plastic roof of a greenhouse depends on the angle of incidence of the light, making the orientation and inclination of the roof play an important role in determining the transmittance of daylight at different times of the day and seasons of the year.\nThe same applies to plastic films and sheets used to filter-out UV radiation in field experiments: the transmittance of the filters will vary reflecting proportionally more PAR and UV radiation when the angle of incidence of sunlight is shallower.\n\n\nThe refractive index, \\(n\\), is dependent on wavelength \\(\\lambda\\). How strong is this dependency, depends on the material. As the refractive index of air is \\(n = 0\\), this simplifies computattions for interfaces involving air. The wavelength dependency of \\(n_\\lambda\\) determines the wavelength dependency of spectral reflectance, \\(R_\\lambda\\), of a non-scattering surface (Figure 5.13).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.13: Spectral reflectance of different materials computed from the spectral refractive index \\(n_\\lambda\\) for an angle of incidence of \\(60^\\circ\\) away from the normal. Within each type of material \\(n_\\lambda\\) can vary and a result of oxydation of metal surfaces and additives and surface coatings on glass and plastic sheets.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a rough surface, different points of the receiving surface are at different angles to the light beam, thus the equations above do not apply to the angle between the light beam and the plate as a whole. In addition, inclusions like air bubbles and small particles of a material with a different \\(n\\) than the material matrix create additional interfaces within the plate. In all these cases, different photons are reflected at different angles, scattering the light. These are some of the properties used for making diffusive plates from clear materials. In a perfect diffuser internal absorptance \\(A_i = 0\\), and half of the incoming photons exit from each face of a thin plate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefractive index\n\n\n\nThe refractive index, \\(n\\), is a property of a material, but we must remember that, for example, corrosion of the surface of a metal plate, changes the material at the interface with air into an oxide. Thus, the corresponding value of \\(n\\) also changes. Furthermore, corrosion of a polished metal surface frequently increases roughness, and thus scattering of the reflected light can also increase.\n\n\nWhen the material does not absorb any of the photons travelling through it, i.e., its internal absorptance \\(A_i = 0\\), and consequently, its internal transmittance \\(T_i = 1\\), total transmittance is given by \\(T_t = 1 - R_t\\), where \\(R_t\\) is the total reflectance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\nThe surface of a water body reflects more light when the sun is low in the sky than at noon, at least if the surface of the air-water interface is horizontal and undisturbed by waves. Waves can be expected to increase reflectance when the sun is high in the sky by changing the average angle of incidence away from the normal, but to decrease it when the sun is low in the sky by altering the average angle of incidence in the opposite direction.\nIn the absence of waves, specular reflection predominates, and how the surface looks to us depends on our position relative to the sun and clouds. With waves, how the water surface looks to us will be less dependent on our position and we will no longer recognize the reflection of clouds and the sun (Figure 5.14).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.14: Sunlight reflection from the surface of a water body depends on the angle of incidence of the sun onto the surface. In this example, bright specular reflections towards the camera are seen only for specific angles between the water surface, the sun and the camera.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany materials do absorb photons as they travel through them. The proportion of the photons incident at the surface and not reflected, i.e., entering the medium that remain at different depths in the medium depends on how many are absorbed or have deviated from their original direction of travel. Thus, absorption and scattering within a medium attenuate the light beam as photons travel through the medium, as discussed next.\n\n\n5.4.2 Attenuation\nWe use the term attenuation irrespective of whether the decrease in irradiance and radiance is due to absorption, scattering or reflection. Absorption implies that the energy is transferred to the medium causing the attenuation, while reflection and scattering as discussed above, are due to changes in the angle or direction in which light propagates. Absorption and scattering are “inherent optical processes”, because they depend on the characteristics of the material itself and are independent of the light field. In addition, re-emission of absorbed photons as fluorescence can moderate overall attenuation as well as alter the spectral composition. Bioluminiscence, emission of light by conversion of other forms of energy into light is possible, and can be important in aquatic systems. We next discuss how light interacts with a medium as it travels through it, considering absorption and scattering.\nThe number of photons absorbed, or amount of energy transferred, depends on the distance travelled within the medium, thus a gradient is created along the light path. In the simple case of a light beam normal to the boundaries of a “slice” of a non scattering material, such as a true solution in the cuvette of a spectrophotometer, the length of the path is given by the thickness of the “slice”.\nAt shallower angles of incidence, the effective path becomes longer (Figure 5.15). However, the angle used to compute the length of the path is not the angle of incidence \\(\\alpha\\) because refraction changes this angle into \\(\\beta\\). Specular reflectance takes place symmetrically to the incidence angle, at angle \\(\\alpha^\\prime\\). The value of \\(\\beta\\) is dependent on \\(n\\), the diagram was computed for \\(n = 1.36\\) (Figure 5.15).\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        image/svg+xml\n        \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              n = 1.36\n            \n            \n          \n          \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nFigure 5.15: Refraction alters the angle of the beam, creating reflection but also displaces the transmitted light beam, modifying the path length. From Wiki Commons\n\n\n\nEven if continuous, we can conceptually divide media into layers to describe how light is attenuated as photons travel through them. Here we consider a layer between horizontal planes \\(z_0\\) and \\(z_1\\), within the matrix of the medium (Figure 5.16). Thus, we can ignore refraction and reflectance at material interfaces. The processes responsible for the changes in the radiance \\(L(\\lambda,\\theta,\\phi)\\) as a radiation beam travels through a material, are primarily absorption \\(a\\) and scattering \\(s\\), where \\(\\lambda\\) stands for wavelength, and \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\phi\\) are angles relative to the planes delimiting the slice.\nRadiance is not only attenuated, it can also be added to the directly transmitted beam, coming from different directions, due to elastic scattering, by which a photon changes direction but not wavelength or energy level3. An example of this is Raleigh scattering by very small particles, which causes the scattering of light in a rainbow. A further, wavelength-specific gain of radiance into the direct path is possible through inelastic processes like fluorescence, where a photon is absorbed by the material and reemitted as a photon with a longer wavelength and lower energy level, and through Raman scattering. The elastic and inelastic scattered radiances are denoted as \\(L^E\\) and \\(L^I\\), respectively. Internal sources of radiance, \\(L^S\\), like bioluminescence of biological organisms or cells contribute also to the detected radiance. The path of the light beam through a thin horizontal layer with thickness \\(\\Delta z=z_1-z_0\\) is shown schematically in Figure 5.16.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.16: Path of the radiance and influences of absorbing and scattering particles in a thin homogeneous horizontal layer of air or water. The layer is separated from other layers of different characteristics by boundary lines at height \\(z_0\\) and \\(z_1\\).\n\n\n\nPutting together the different components described above, the radiative transfer equation is obtained \\[\\cos\\theta\\,\\frac{{\\rm d}L}{{\\rm d}z} = -(a+s)\\times L + L^E + L^I + L^S \\label{equ_rte}\\] The dependencies of \\(L\\) on \\(\\lambda\\), \\(\\theta\\), and \\(\\phi\\) are omitted here for brevity. No exact analytical solution to the radiative transfer equation exists, hence it is necessary either to use numerical models or to use analytical approximations.\nThe parameters of the light field can be simulated by modelling the paths of photons, also called “ray tracing”. For an infinite number of photons, the light field parameters reach their exact values asymptotically. The advantage of numerical simulation methods is a relatively simple structure of the program, but its disadvantage is the time-consuming computation involved. Details of the application of the Monte Carlo method to simulations are explained for example by Prahl et al. (1989), Wang, Jacques, and Zheng (1995)4, or Mobley (1994).\nThe other way to solve the radiative transfer equation is through the development of analytical approximations for all the quantities needed. In this case, the result is not exact, but it has the advantage of fast computation and that the analytical equations can be inverted easily. This leads to the idealised case of a source-free (\\(L^S=0\\)) and non-scattering media, i.e., \\(b=0\\) and therefore \\(L^E=L^I=0\\). Then, equation XXXX can be integrated easily to yield\n\\[L(z_1) = L(z_0)\\times \\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{a\\cdot(z_1-z_0)}{\\cos\\theta}}\\]\nThe radiance value at the upper boundary, \\(L(z_0)\\), is presumed known. This equation is known as Beer’s law (or Lambert’s law, Bouguer’s law, Beer-Lambert law), and describes any instance of exponential attenuation of light and is exact only for purely absorbing media—i.e., media that do not scatter radiation. It is of direct application in analytical chemistry, as it describes the direct proportionality of absorbance (\\(A\\)) to the concentration of a “coloured” solute in a transparent solvent. True solutions are optically homogeneous, while suspensions and aerosols are not. The latter scatter light and their behaviour is different from that described by Beer’s law. In chemistry, Beer’s law is formulated in a simplified way by assuming a collimated light beam incident at 90 degrees\n\\[I_\\lambda(z_1) = I_\\lambda(z_0) \\times \\mathrm{e}^{-k_\\lambda\\times c\\times l}\\] where \\(I_\\lambda(z_0)\\) and \\(I_\\lambda(z_1)\\) are irradiances, \\(k_\\lambda\\) is the attenuation coefficient of the solute, \\(c\\) is the concentration of the solute, and \\(l = z_1 - z_0\\) is the path length. As the value of \\(k_\\lambda\\) is a function of wavelength, \\(\\lambda\\), how much \\(I\\) is attenuated also depends on \\(\\lambda\\).\nThis equation can be used to compute irradiance at any point in the path by varying \\(l\\) if \\(k_\\lambda\\) and \\(c\\) are known. In chemical analysis, the equation is used to estimate \\(c\\) with \\(k_\\lambda\\) and \\(l\\) known. For a valid estimate, all the quantities must be expressed in coherent units, and the solvent should not absorb photons in the wavelength range of interest. In practice, in most cases both the pure solvent and the solution are measured, and the effect of the solute obtained by difference. A calibration curve based on a dilution series of known concentrations is safest when the pure solute is available.\nIrradiance in a solution changes with path length following an exponential attenuation curve, i.e., the curve is asymptotic (Figure 5.17).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.17: Hypothetical light attenuation curve computed with the Beer-Lambert equation assuming \\(k \\times c = 5\\). This figure illustrates the shape of the curve, while the \\(z_i - z_0\\) are arbitrary path lengths \\(l\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRadiation transfer models\n\n\n\nRadiation transfer models like TUV and libradtran simulate the modifying effect of the atmosphere on extraterrestrial solar spectral irradiance to estimate the daylight spectrum at ground level or at different elevations within the atmosphere. Importantly, these models compute the effect of the surface albedo, aerosols, clouds and particles in the atmosphere.\nThe output from both models can be either spectral irradiance or spectral radiance. They also estimate the direct and diffuse components, as well as the upwelling scattered radiation from the ground surface.\nBoth libradtran (Emde et al. 2016) and TUV models can be installed and run locally, while a simplified interactive on-line application Quick TUV Calculator is available. R package ‘photobiologyInOut’ can import data generated by these models into R objects. R package ‘forqat’ can do simulation with TUV, either locally installed or using the Quick TUV API, directly from within R.\nRadiation transfer models have also been developed for simulation of the within canopies (e.g., Chelle, Andrieu, and Bouatouch 1998; Chelle et al. 2007) and as well as within leaves, e.g. PROSPECT (Feret et al. 2008; Li et al. 2023).\n\n\n\n\n5.4.3 Radiation, Atoms and Molecules\nI propose here a new section, that needs to be consistent with what Wolfgang will write about related subjects.\nA pigment is a light absorbing chemical or biochemical molecule. Which wavelengths are absorbed or not is determined by the allowed energy levels and transitions because only photons with “matching” energy can be absorbed. Pigment molecules with enhanced energy states as a result of an interaction with one or more photons are said to be “excited”. The additional energy absorbed from photons can be dissipated through different excitation decay mechanisms. Excitation can also lead to conformational changes in proteins and modify their readiness to interact with other molecules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe principles of photochemistry\n\n\n\nLight is electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths to which the human eye, as well as the photosynthetic apparatus, is sensitive (\\(\\lambda \\approx\\) 400 to 700 nm). However, sometimes the word light is also used to refer to other nearby regions of the spectrum: ultraviolet (shorter wavelengths than visible light) and infra-red (longer wavelengths). Both particle and wave attributes of radiation are needed for a complete description of its behaviour. Light particles or quanta are called photons.\nSensing of visible and radiation by plants and other organisms starts as a photochemical event, and is ruled by the basic principles of photochemistry:\nGrotthuss law: Only radiation that is actually absorbed can produce a chemical change.\nStark-Einstein law: Each absorbed quantum activates only one molecule.\nAs electrons in molecules can have only discrete energy levels, only photons that provide a quantity of energy adequate for an electron to ‘jump’ to another possible energetic state can be absorbed. The consequence of this is that substances have colours, i.e. they absorb photons with only certain energies. See Nobel (2009) and Lars Olof Björn (2007) for detailed descriptions of the interactions between light and matter.\n\n\nIn the case of photoreceptors the operationally relevant mechanism is triggering a cascade of events in a transduction change, most frequently, but not only, resulting in changes in gene expression, protein localization or membrane permeability.\nFluorescence is the “decay” of part of the energy acquired through absorption of radiation, by emission of radiation of longer wavelength (photos of lower energy) (Figure 5.18). This red-shift is caused by action of competing routes for energy dissipation, such as thermal energy loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.18: The Perrin-Jablonski diagram showing energy states. The absorption of a photon is depicted together with the different pathways for energy disipation. Energy increases upwards on the vertical axis. (Modified from diagram by Germain Salvato-Vallverdu.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpectral absorptance\n\n\n\nAbsorptance, \\(\\alpha\\), and absorbance, \\(A\\), are wavelength dependent. We perceive this as colour. The colour of things is ultimately determined by the allowed energy states of molecules “selecting” which photons are absorbed or not, and fluorescence of which wavelength is emitted. This is because, as seen above the energy of a photon corresponds to matching wavelength, and thus, also colour.\nWhen fluorescence occurs as the result of the interaction of a molecule with a single photon, fluorescence is necessarily emitted as photons of at most slightly lower energy than the absorbed ones. There are exceptional cases when the energy gained from more than one photon drives the emission of a single photon of higher energy, and thus shorter wavelength. Obviously the flux of energy emitted as radiation remains less than that absorbed, but shared among fewer photons.\nLarge molecules like photoreceptors contain many electrons and can change in configuration after absorption of a photon. With many allowed energy states they tend to display spectra with multiple broad peaks.\n\n\nFor molecules in an ideal solution their interaction with the medium modifies the allowed energy states and thus, also their absorption spectrum, but, usually, only slightly (Figure 5.19). In this same case, of molecules in solution, it is convenient to express their ability to absorb light per mole. The IUPAC-recommended name for this property is called molecular attenuance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.19: Normalised absorbance spectrum of chlorophyll a in methanol and diethyl ether.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen light drives a photochemical reaction, the quantity quantun yield describes the reaction efficiency as the ratio between the rate at which the product molecules are pruced and the rate at which photons are being absorbed. The units are mol mol\\(^{-1}\\).\nFinally it is possible to combine molecular attenuance and quantun yield to describe the rate of a photochemical reaction relative to incident radiation.\nSome ideas of what could be still\n\nDecay/quenching: thermal, fluorescence, phosphorescence\nLuminescence\nmolar cross section\n\n\n\n5.4.4 Quantities Describing Light-Matter Interactions\nRadiation incident on an object can be partitioned into three components based on its fate,\n\\[1 = R^\\mathrm{tot} + \\alpha + T^\\mathrm{tot}\\] where \\(R^\\mathrm{tot}\\), \\(\\alpha\\), and \\(T^\\mathrm{tot}\\) are expressed as fractions Table 5.5. Alternatively, they can be expressed as percentages.\nIf \\(I_0\\) is the irradiance on the surface of an object, the “irradiance” entering the body of the object is given by \\(I_0 \\times (1 - R^\\mathrm{tot})\\). The irradiance exiting the opposite side of the object is given by \\(I_0 \\times T^\\mathrm{tot}\\).\nInternal transmittance \\(T^\\mathrm{int}\\) considers only the radiation entering the object, thus,\n\\[1 = \\alpha + T^\\mathrm{int}\\] from which it follows that always \\(T^\\mathrm{int} \\geq T^\\mathrm{tot}\\). To convert \\(T^\\mathrm{int}\\) into \\(T^\\mathrm{tot}\\) we need to know \\(R^\\mathrm{tot}\\),\n\\[T^\\mathrm{tot} = T^\\mathrm{int} \\times (1 - R^\\mathrm{tot})\\] and \\[T^\\mathrm{int} = \\frac{T^\\mathrm{tot}}{1 - R^\\mathrm{tot}}\\]\nAbsorbance (\\(A\\)) is a logarithm-transformed quantity. In Chemistry \\(A\\) is most frequently computed using base-10 logarithm, while is some other fiels natural or \\(e\\)-based logarithms are used.\n\\[A = -\\log_{10}(1 - \\alpha) = -\\log_{10}(T^\\mathrm{int}) = -\\log_{10}(R^\\mathrm{tot} + T^\\mathrm{tot})\\]\nWe use \\(A\\) as symbol for decadic absorbance, for which \\(A_{10}\\) may be used in other publications. We use the subscript to indicate the wavelength in nanometres (nm), e.g., \\(A_{663}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nAs discussed earlier in this chapter, in the Beer-Lambert equation solute concentration enters as an exponent, i.e., a power of \\(e\\). Thus, \\(A \\propto c\\), and a convenient quantity for assessing concentrations of a solute as \\(c = A \\times k\\) where \\(k\\) is the slope of an empirical calibration curve.\nIn chemistry and biochemistry when using a spectrophotometer it is the norm to measure a blank as reference. The assumption is that \\(R^\\mathrm{tot}\\) is the same for the blank and the sample, thus the difference between blank and sample, corresponds to absorptance, \\(\\alpha\\), or \\(1 - T^\\mathrm{int}\\). As the solvent is used for the blank, the difference in absorptance can be attributed to the solute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.5: Physical quantities that describe the interaction of objects and light and related quantities describing intensive properties of materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nUnit\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\\(R^\\mathrm{tot}\\)\nfraction\nTotal reflectance:\n\n\n\\(R^\\mathrm{spcl}\\)\nfraction\nSpecular reflectance:\n\n\n\\(R^\\mathrm{diff}\\)\nfraction\nDiffuse reflectance:\n\n\n\\(n\\)\nnumeric\nRefractive index:\n\n\n\\(T^\\mathrm{tot}\\)\nfraction\nTotal transmittance:\n\n\n\\(T^\\mathrm{int}\\)\nfraction\nInternal transmittance:\n\n\n\\(\\alpha\\)\nfraction\nAbsorptance:\n\n\n\\(A\\)\na.u.\nAbsorbance:",

    "text": "6.1.1 Position of the sun\nWhen studying plants we frequently need to describe the position of the sun because of its effect on spectral irradiance and as a determinant of day length. The azimuth angle (\\(\\phi\\)) is usually measured clockwise from the North on a horizontal plane. The position on the vertical plane is measured either as the zenith angle (\\(\\theta\\)) downwards from the zenith, or as an elevation angle (\\(h\\)) upwards from the horizon. Consequently \\(h + \\theta = 90^\\circ = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\,\\)radians. When describing the position of the sun as in Figure 6.1 the observer is situated at the origin of the system of coordinates used to describe the angles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Diagram showing the angles used to describe the position of the sun in the sky, viewed from the East. h: sun elevation angle, θ: zenith angle, Φ: azimuth angle.\n\n\n\nThe daily path of the sun in the sky depends on the time of the year and the latitude. The time of solar noon depends on the actual geographic location, and nearly always differs from the local-time noon which is based on a time zone and possibly affected by a shift of one or more hours to enhance daylight use, especially in summer time.\nHighly accurate astronomical formulas are available and can be used to compute the current, past and future positions of the sun in the sky (e.g., Meeus 1998). Less accurate, but simpler to compute, formulas also exist. These formulas can also be use to compute day- and night lengths based on different twilight definitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe accuracy of astronomical formulas is less when the sun is near the horizon because, as seen in the previous chapter, the transition from vacuum to the atmosphere introduces a small angular displacement of the light beam depending on the refractive index and angle of incidence. The difficulty is that the refractive index (\\(\\nu\\)) of the air depends on its water content, which is not constant.\n\n\nThe path of the sun in the sky determines the lengths of the day and night. The most frequently used criterion for the day to night and night to days transitions is that the upper rim of the solar disk coincides with the astronomical horizon. As the solar disk is approximately 2 degrees in diameter, the transition between day and night is in this case when the centre of the solar disk is one degree below the horizon. Alternatively, the centre of the solar disk can be used coinciding with the astronomical horizon can be used as the criterion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Position of the sun at sunrise, sunset, dawn and dusk. Figure by TWCarlson available at Wikimedia Commons under CC-BY-SA 3.0.\n\n\n\nTwilight is the period before sunrise and after sunset when there is more intense diffuse light than further into the night (Figure 6.2). The definitions of twilight are based on practical considerations of human activities, and called civil, naval and astronomical (Figure 6.3). During civil twilight artificial lighting is usually not needed in cities. For nautical twilight I have seen two descriptions: 1) before nautical dawn and after nautical dawn it is possible to navigate based on the stars, and 2) after nautical dawn and before nautical dusk navigation by sight is possible. Before astronomical dawn and after astronomical dusk stars of sixth magnitude are visible. These three descriptions are very approximate, as they do not consider the effect of clouds, light pollution from artificial sources, or other source of light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Criteria defining twilight based on the position of the sun. The angles when expressed as sun elevation (\\(h\\)) are negative. Only dawn and sunrise shown. The same angles are used between sunset and dusk. Figure by TWCarlson available at Wikimedia Commons under CC-BY-SA 3.0., edited\n\n\n\nThe day length through the year computed for three cities, one of them, Ivalo at the northern latitude within the Artic circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Day length through the year at different latitudes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we include twilight, the estimated length of the photoperiod increases (Figure 6.5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: Photoperiod duration computed for sunrise/sunset or for dawn/dusk according to different twilight definitions. The curve describes the elevation angle of the sun through the day at Helsinki, Finalnd, on the 21 March 2024. The horizontal lines show the elevation angles used as the boundary of the “photoperiod” and the numbers above each of these lines give the corresponding length of the photoperiod in hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nEven though day length or photoperiod duration is normally based on the astronomical horizon, in many cases there are obstacles that occlude the sun from view until later at dawn or earlier at dusk: mountains, vegetation, buildings, etc. Thus, in some cases it may be more relevant for a scientific study with plants to consider sun elevation angles \\(h &gt; 0\\) as the criterion; even different angles can be used for day start and day end.\nThe question remains of what light level is actually detected by plants and other organisms as the night-day and day-night transitions. Most likely the exact value depends on the genotype and the realized phenotype. However, at dawn and dusk irradiance increases and decreases, respectively, qquite fast at low and medium latitudes. At high latitudes, at some times the year twilight lasts for a long time making the change in irradiance more gradual. At civil dawn/dusk irradiance is already very low.\n\n\nThe dependency of the elevation angle on time of the year and latitude is illustrated in Figure 6.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6: Sun elevation angle through the day at five different latitudes and four dates. The horizontal dotted lines show the horizon (\\(h = 0\\)). The range limits for the x and y axes are consistent across all plots.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd links to previous chapter\n\n\n6.1.2 The spectrum of solar radiation\nThe solar “constant” varies between 1.361 and 1.362 \\(W m^{-2}\\) due to changes in solar activity. The solar spectrum at the top of the atmosphere varies very little in time, and is usually assumed constant.\nIn outer space, in vacuum, no scattering takes place as the light travels, and because of this, the sky looks completely black. Planets and the Moon do reflect light allowing us to see them.\nBefore reaching the Earth’s surface radiation from the sun travels through the atmosphere. The sun elevation angle affects the length of the path that the light arriving from the sun travels through the atmosphere. In atmospheric physics it is common to describe spectra as corresponding to AM1 when the sun is at the zenith, i.e., AM1 stands for one atmosphere thickness and AM1.5 indicates that the length of the path through the atmosphere is 1.5 times that when the sun is at the zenith.\nThe length of the path through the atmosphere is, in reality, not exactly the length computed by trigonometry, but close to it. An empirical formula can be used as an approximation (Kasten1989?) to compute AM values from the elevation angle (\\(h\\)) (Figure 6.7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.7: Plot of the empirical relationship between sun elevation (\\(h\\)) or zenith anglr (\\(\\theta\\)) and “equivalent” atmosphere thickness traversed by solar radiation between outer space and the Earth’s surface (at sea level). AM1 is indicated by the horizontal dotted line.\n\n\n\n\n\nLight when travelling through the atmosphere interacts with the gases and particles composing it. The light is attenuated and scattered . Different wavelengths are differently affected by these processes, giving us a blue sky and warmer coloured direct sunlight. In other words, the daylight spectrum depends on the position of the sun in the sky, and on the composition of the atmosphere along this path (Figure 6.8 and Figure 6.9). In addition to molecular absorption and scattering, aerosols, both liquid like water and solid like ice and dust, interact with light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.8: The spectrum of solar radiation above the atmosphere (AM0) and a typical spectrum at ground level (AM1.5). Spectral energy irradiance for the wavelength range called shortwave radiation in meteorology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.9: The spectrum of solar radiation above the atmosphere (AM0) and a typical spectrum at ground level (AM1.5). Spectral photon irradiance for the range 250 to 900 nm.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove, we used the word light with its everyday meaning. Its technical definition is of radiation visible to humans. Ultraviolet, visible and infrared radiation (taken together are called in meteorolgy shortwave radiation) are components of solar radiation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRadiation from the sun reaches the Earth’s surface in about eight minutes (\\(t\\) = time, \\(r_0\\) = distance sun to earth, \\(c\\) = velocity of light in vacuum): \\[t = \\frac{r_0}{c} \\approx \\frac{150 \\times 10^9 ~{\\rm m}}{3 \\times 10^8 ~\\frac{\\rm m}{\\rm s}} = 500 ~{\\rm s} = 8.3 ~{\\rm min}\\].\n\n\nThe energy radiance (\\(L\\)) of radiation emitted by the sun is similar, but not identical, to the emission spectrum of a black body. The solar spectrum has a fine structure of peaks and valleys arising from the atoms and molecules in the sun while black body emission is described by a smooth curve. A “match” based on the wavelength at which spectral energy radiance is at its maximum can be used as criterion to estimate the temperature of the sun’s surface. Obviously, we use the extraterrestrial spectrum for this match. We see in the AM0 curve in Figure 6.8 that the wavelength at the maximum is near 500 nm. In reality the temperature of the sun surface is not uniform, and different sources mention as its average temperatures between 5800 K and 5500 K. Comparing the AM0 curve in Figure 6.8 to the 5800 K curve in Figure 6.10 the similary of their shapes is clear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.10: Radiance spectra for black bodies at three different temperatures; 5800 K (blue), 5000 K (orange) and 3700 K (red).\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanck’s law describes black body emission at temperature \\(T\\) (Figure 6.10), expressed as absolute temperature measured in degrees Kelvin (K):\n\\[L_s(\\lambda,T) = \\frac{2hc^2}{\\lambda^5}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{e}^{(hc/k_\\mathrm{B}T\\lambda)}-1}\\]\nwith Boltzmann’s constant \\(k_\\mathrm{B}=1.381\\times 10^{-23}\\) .\nThe “equivalent temperature” of a black body is given by Wien’s displacement law (Figure 6.11), which gives the wavelength at which the radiative energy emitted by a black body is at its maximum as a function of its absolute temperature.\n\\[\\lambda_\\mathrm{max} \\cdot T = 2.898 \\times 10^6 \\,{\\rm nm\\,K}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.11: The peak wavelength of radiation emission by a black body as a function of its absolute (surface) temperature. The approximate temperature of the sun \\(T_\\mathrm{sun} \\approx 5800\\,\\mathrm{K}\\) is highlighted by a yellow-filled circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe concept of “colour temperature” used for describing the emission of lamps used for illumination and more generaly in photography differs in that it takes into account human colour vision when determining the match between the black body emission spectrum and the spectrum of an arbitrary light source.\ncompute CCT\n\n\nThe spectral irradiance of the sun \\(\\irr[s](\\lambda)\\) can be estimated assuming a homogeneous flux and using the correlation of intensity and radiance from their definitions in table [tab:Phys:Quants]. The intensity of the sun \\(\\intensity[s](\\lambda)\\) is given by the radiance \\(\\radiance[s](\\lambda)\\) multiplied by the apparent sun surface (a non-tilted disk of radius \\(r_s=7\\times 10^5\\) km). To calculate the decreased solar irradiance at the moment of reaching the Earth’s atmosphere, the distance of the sun to the Earth (\\(r_0=150\\times 10^6\\) km) has to be taken into account due to the inverse square law of irradiance of equation ([equ_r2law]). Thus, the extraterrestrial solar irradiance is \\[\\irr[s](\\lambda)=\\radiance[s](\\lambda)\\cdot\\frac{\\pi r_s^2}{r_0^2}\\label{equ_extraterrestrial}\\] Remembering the solid angle of equation ([equ_solidangle]), the right multiplication factor represents the solid angle of the sun’s disk as seen from the Earth’s surface (\\(\\approx 6.8\\times 10^{-5}\\) sr). Figure [fig_sun] shows the spectrum of the measured extraterrestrial solar radiation (Wehrli, 1985)1 and the spectrum calculated by equation 1.14 using Planck’s law of equation 1.12 at a black body temperature of 5800 K. Integrated over all wavelengths, \\(\\irr[s]\\) is about 1361 to 1362 at top of the atmosphere (Kopp and Lean 2011). This value is called the ‘solar constant’. In former times, depending on different measurements, \\(\\irr[s]\\) varies by a few percent (Iqbal 1983). For example, the irradiance at the top of the atmosphere (the integrated value) changes by \\(\\pm 50\\) (3.7 %) during the year due to distance variation caused by orbit excentricity (Mobley 1994). More accurate measurements during the last 25 years by spaceborne radiometers show a variability of the solar radiation of a few tenth of a percent. A detailed analysis is given by Fröhlich and Lean (2004). \\(\\irr[s]\\) can also be calculated by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: the total energy emitted from the surface of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature. For an isotropically emitting source (Lambertian emitter), this means \\[\\radiance = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\pi} \\cdot T^4 \\label{equ_boltzmann}\\] with the Stefan-Boltzmann constant \\(\\sigma=5.6705\\times 10^{-8}\\) W m\\(^{-2}\\) K\\(^{-4}\\). With \\(T = 5800\\) K equation [equ_boltzmann] gives the radiance of the solar disc. From this value, we can obtain an approximation of the solar constant, by taking into account the distance from the Earth to the Sun and the apparent size of the solar disc (see equations [equ_solidangle] and [equ_r2law]).\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nThe total solar irradiance covers a wide range of wavelengths. Using some of the ‘colours’ introduced in table [tab:Waverange], table [tab_sun] lists the irradiance and fraction of \\(\\irr[s]\\) of different wavelength intervals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColour\nWavelength (nm)\nIrradiance ()\nFraction of \\(\\irr[s]\\) (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n100 – 280\n7\n0.5\n\n\n\n280 – 315\n17\n1.2\n\n\n\n315 – 400\n84\n6.1\n\n\nVIS\n400 – 700\n531\n38.9\n\n\nnear IR\n700 – 1000\n309\n22.6\n\n\nmid and far IR\n\\(&gt;\\) 1000\n419\n30.7\n\n\ntotal\n\n1367\n100.0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe extraterrestrial solar spectrum differs from that at ground level due to the absorption of radiation by the atmosphere, because the absorption peaks of water, and other components of the atmosphere, cause corresponding valleys to appear in the solar spectrum at ground level. For example, estimates from measurements of the total global irradiance at Helmholtz Zentrum München (11.60\\(\\degree\\) E, 48.22\\(\\degree\\) N, 490 m above sea level) on two sunny days (17\\(^{\\rm th}\\) April 1996, sun zenith angle of 38\\(^\\circ\\) and 27\\(^{\\rm th}\\) May 2005, 27\\(^\\circ\\)) result in about 5% for wavelengths below 400 nm, about 45% from 400 to 700 nm, and about 50% above 700 nm. In relation to plant research, only the coarse structure of peaks and valleys is relevant, because absorption spectra of pigments in vivo have broad peaks and valleys. However, the solar spectrum has a much finer structure, due to emission and absorption lines of elements, which is not observable with the spectroradiometers normally used in plant research.\nAt the Earth’s surface, the incident radiation or global:rad has two components, direct:rad and diffuse:rad. Direct radiation is radiation travelling directly from the sun, while diffuse radiation is that scattered by the atmosphere. Diffuse radiation is what gives the blue colour to the sky and white colour to clouds. The relative contribution of direct and diffuse radiation to global radiation varies with wavelength and weather conditions. The contribution of diffuse radiation is larger in the UV region, and in the presence of clouds (Figures [fig:sky:photos] and [fig:diffuse:UV]).\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nNot only total irradiance, but also the wavelength distribution of the solar spectrum changes with the seasons of the year and time of day. The spectral wavelength distribution is also changed by the amount of -absorbing ozone in the atmosphere, known as the ozone column. Figure [fig:solar:spectra:one:day] shows how spectral irradiance changes throughout one day. When the whole spectrum is plotted using a linear scale the effect of ozone depletion is not visible, however, if we plot only the region (Figure [fig:solarUV:spectrum:noon]) or use a logarithmic scale (Figure [fig:solar:spectra:one:day:log]), the effect becomes clearly visible. In addition, on a log scale, it is clear that the relative effect of ozone depletion on the spectral irradiance at a given wavelength increases with decreasing wavelength.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nSeasonal variation in irradiance has a larger relative amplitude than variation in (Figure [fig:diffuse.light]). This causes a seasonal variation in the : ratio (Figure [fig:UVB:Erlangen]). In addition to the regular seasonal variation, there is random variation as a result of changes in clouds (Figure [fig:UVB:Erlangen]). Normal seasonal and spatial variation in can be sensed by plants, and could play a role in their adaptation to seasons and/or their position in the canopy.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nirradiance increases with elevation in mountains and with decreasing latitude (Figure [fig:UVB:latitude]) and is particularly high on high mountains in equatorial regions. This has been hypothesized to be a factor in the determination of the tree line2 in these mountains (Flenley 1992).\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nAn increase in the irradiance is caused by depletion of the ozone layer in the stratosphere, mainly as a consequence of the release of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), used in cooling devices such as refrigerators and air conditioners, and in some spray cans (see Graedel and Crutzen 1993). The most dramatic manifestation of this has been the seasonal formation of an “ozone hole” over Antarctica. It is controversial whether a true ozone hole has already formed in the Arctic, but strong depletion has occurred in year 2011 (Manney et al. 2011) and atmospheric conditions needed for the formation of a “deep” ozone hole are not very different from those prevalent in recent years. Not so dramatic, but consistent, depletion has also been observed at mid-latitudes in both hemispheres. CFCs and some other halocarbons have been phased out following the Montreal agreement and later updates. However, as CFCs have a long half life in the atmosphere, of the order of 100 years, their effect on the ozone layer will persist for many years, even after their use has been drastically reduced. Model-based predictions of changes in atmospheric circulation due to global climate change have been used to derive future trends in index and ozone column thickness (Hegglin and Shepherd 2009). In addition, increased cloudiness and pollution, could lead to decreased and , sometimes called ‘global dimming’ (e.g. Stanhill and Cohen 2001). It should be noted that, through reflection, broken clouds can locally increase irradiance to values above those under clear-sky conditions (Frederick et al. 1993; Díaz et al. 1996).",

The spatial distribution of leaves is in most cases not uniform, the display angle of the leaves is not random, and may change with depth in the canopy, and even in some cases with time-of-day. Here we give only a description of the simplest approach, the use of an approximation based on Beer’s law as modified by Monsi and Saeki (1953), reviewed by Hirose (2005). Beer’s law (Equation [eq:Beer-Lambert]) assumes a homogeneous light absorbing medium such as a solution. However, a canopy is heterogenous, with discrete light absorbing objects (the leaves and stems) distributed in a transparent medium (air). \\[I_z = I_0\\cdot\\mathrm{e}^{-K\\,L_z} \\label{eq:Monsi:Saeki}\\] Equation [eq:Monsi:Saeki] describes the radiation attenuated as a function of leaf area index (\\(L\\) or ) at a given canopy depth (\\(z\\)). The equation does not explicitly account for the effects of the statistical spatial distribution of leaves and the effects of changing incidence angle of the radiation. Consequently, the empirical extinction coefficient (\\(K\\)) obtained may vary depending on these factors. \\(K\\) is not only a function of plant species (through leaf optical properties, and how leaves are displayed), but also of time-of-day, and season-of-year—as a consequence of solar zenith angle—and degree of scattering of the incident radiation. As the degree of scattering depends on clouds, and also on wavelength, the extinction coefficient is different for and visible radiation. Radiation extinction in canopies has yet to be studied in detail with respect to radiation, mainly because of difficulties in the measurement of radiation compared to , a spectral region which has been extensively studied.\nUltraviolet radiation is strongly absorbed by plant surfaces, although cuticular waxes and pubescence on leaves can sometimes increase reflectance. The diffuse component of radiation is larger than that of visible light (Figure [fig:diffuse.light]). In sunlit patches in forest gaps the diffuse radiation percentage is lower than in open areas, because direct:rad is not attenuated but part of the sky is occluded by the surrounding forest. Attenuation with canopy depth is on average usually more gradual for than for . The irradiance decreases with depth in tree canopies, but the ratio tends to increase (see Brown, Parker, and Posner 1994). In contrast, Deckmyn, Cayenberghs, and Ceulemans (2001) observed a decrease in ratio in white clover canopies with planophyle leaves. Allen, Gausman, and Allen (1975) modelled the penetration in plant canopies, under normal and depleted ozone conditions. Parisi and Wong (1996) measured doses within model plant canopies using dosimeters. The position of leaves affects exposure, and it has been observed that heliotropism can moderate exposure and could be a factor contributing to differences in tolerance among crop cultivars (Grant 1998, 1999a, 1999b, 2004).\nDetailed accounts of different models describing the interaction of radiation and plant canopies, taking into account the properties of foliage, are given by Campbell and Norman (1998) and Monteith and Unsworth (2008).",

    "text": "6.3 UV radiation in aquatic environments\nAs solar radiation passes through a body of water, its spectrum changes with depth in a wavelength-dependent manner, determined by the optical characteristics of that water body. The penetration of UV radiation through water bodies can vary from only few centimetres in highly humic lakes (Kirk 1994a, 1994b; P. S. Huovinen, Penttilä, and Soimasuo 2003) to dozens of metres in the oceans (Smith et al. 1992; Kirk 1994a, 1994b). Some irradiance is reflected at the water surface, but the extent to which wavelengths in the UV to IR range penetrate water bodies depends mainly on (1) attenuation by water itself, (2) coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and seston. Seston is the sum of living organic material (mainly phytoplankton) and non-living material (tripton). Non-living particles are further distinguished between organic material (detritus) and inorganic suspended matter. Each fraction has its own characteristic spectral absorption and scattering properties (reviewed by Dekker 1993; Kirk 1994a, 1994b; Hargreaves 2003; Wozniak and Dera 2007).\nParticularly in coastal areas and shallow areas of lakes and streams, irradiance reflected from the ground or sea-bed beneath the water (henceforth bottom) influences the profile of radiation through the aquatic environment. This reflectance is described by a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), which is wavelength specific and depends on the incident and reflected angle. If the reflectance is equally distributed in all directions, the bottom is a so called Lambertian reflector and the BRDF is constant. The bottom reflectance is greatly influenced by its slope and properties, i.e. whether the bottom is bare sediment or covered by algae and submersed vegetation (e.g. Maritorena, Morel, and Gentili 1994; Albert and Mobley 2003; Mobley and Sundman 2003; Mobley, Zhang, and Voss 2003; Pinnel 2007).\n\n6.3.1 Refraction\nThe refraction of incoming (downwelling) radiance at the water surface can be determined by Snell’s law, which describes the angular refraction of the incident beam. The radiation passes the first medium with a refractive index \\(n_1\\) and then the second medium with a refractive index \\(n_2\\). If the incoming direction of the radiation is given by the angle \\(\\theta_1\\), the beam is refracted to the angle \\(\\theta_2\\). Snell’s law is \\[n_1 \\cdot \\sin\\theta_1 = n_2 \\cdot \\sin\\theta_2\\] For the case of radiation arriving from the air under the incident angle \\(\\theta_i\\) and going into the water with the transmitted angle \\(\\theta_t\\), this yields a refractive index for the air of \\(n_a=1\\) and for the water of \\(n_W=1.33\\) \\[\\theta_t = \\arcsin \\left( 0.75\\cdot \\sin\\theta_i \\right)\\]\nTheoretically, \\(n_W\\) is not constant but depends on temperature, wavelength and salinity, as described by Quan and Fry (1995). In principle, the shorter the wavelength, the higher the refractive index of water, but in practice the wavelength-dependent difference in refraction is unimportant. For example comparing the values at 400 and 800 nm for 20and no salinity produces a difference of \\(&lt;\\) 0.5%. If the wind speed is high, the slope of surface waves also has to be taken into account. A rough surface reflects and transmits the incoming radiation beam in more directions and makes the radiation field more diffuse than a smooth surface.\n\n\n6.3.2 Absorption and scattering by pure water\nWater itself absorbs and scatters radiation. The optical properties of the water in the visible and ultraviolet (UV) spectrum are not precisely known, since no theoretical model exists which exactly describes the absorption and scattering properties of pure water. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on laboratory measurements to approximate the values of these parameters. Investigations into absorption by water \\(a_W\\) were initially documented by Morel (1974), Smith and Tyler (1976), Smith and Baker (1981), Pegau and Zaneveld (1993) and more recently by Buiteveld, Hakvoort, and Donze (1994) and Hakvoort (1994). The absorption properties of water also depend on temperature. The influence of temperature is weak below 700 nm, but its effect increases with increasing wavelength; so, for example, a temperature increase of 10 K produces a \\(\\approx\\)7% change in the absolute value of \\(a_W\\) at 740 nm.\nThe scattering of radiation by molecules in liquids has been modelled theoretically by Smoluchowski (1908) and Einstein (1910). This approach is based on statistical thermodynamics and is called the theory of fluctuation. Theoretically, the scattering function is wavelength-dependent and follows the \\(\\lambda^{-4}\\) law. Experiments show a slight deviation from the model, giving a better correlation with \\(\\lambda^{-4.32}\\) (Morel 1974) due to the effects of isothermal compressibility, the refractive index of water, and the pressure derivative of the refractive index of water (Hakvoort 1994).\nThe wavelength dependency of the absorption and scattering coefficients of pure water are shown in Figure [fig:Water:Abs_Scat] using data from Hakvoort (1994). Water mainly contributes to the attenuation of PAR and IR wavelengths, since absorption by pure water increases from around 550 nm towards longer wavelengths.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3.3 Absorption and scattering by water constituents\nAbsorption and scattering by water constituents is the sum of (1) absorption by CDOM, sometimes also called yellow or humic substances, gilvin or gelbstoff, (2) absorption and scattering by living material like phytoplankton, and (3) absorption and scattering by dead organic and inorganic particles. The influence of each constituent on the scattering process depends on wavelength, particle size, concentration, and refractive index. Theoretical details are explained in, for example, Hulst (1981).\nCDOM mainly refers to coloured dissolved humic materials and consists of humic and fulvic acids, originating from decomposed plant material suspended in the water or entering from the surrounding catchment area. The pigments in humic and fulvic acids absorb strongly in the blue and UV wavelengths and are dissolved and therefore do not scatter irradiance. Kalle (1966) recognised that CDOM absorption decreases exponentially with increasing wavelength in the visible part of the spectra. Following the study of Morel and Prieur (1976), Bricaud, Morel, and Prieur (1981) expressed this relationship in the following model: for a known absorption at a wavelength \\(\\lambda_0=440\\) nm, the CDOM absorption \\(a_Y\\) can be determined by \\[a_Y(\\lambda) = a_Y(\\lambda_0)\\cdot {\\rm e}^{-s_Y(\\lambda-\\lambda_0)} \\label{equ_ay}\\] Although the exponential coefficient \\(s_Y\\) is variable, a standard value of \\(s_Y=0.014\\) nm\\(^{-1}\\) is commonly used. Bricaud, Morel, and Prieur (1981) compared the value of \\(s_Y\\) across many data sets and reported a standard deviation of only \\(\\Delta s_Y=\\pm 0.003\\) nm\\(^{-1}\\). The amount of CDOM in water is determined by filtration using membrane filters of 0.2 \\(\\mymu\\)m pore size. The filtrate is collected into a quartz cuvette with length \\(l\\) and put into a (double beam) spectrophotometer to measure its absorbance (optical density) \\(A(\\lambda)\\). Then, \\(a_Y(\\lambda)=2.303\\cdot\\frac{A(\\lambda)}{l}\\) (Kirk 1994a). The absorption coefficient at 440 nm has been used as an indication of optical colour (Kirk 1994a), while size of humic molecules has been estimated from the ratio \\(\\frac{a_Y(\\lambda=250{\\rm nm})}{a_Y(\\lambda={\\rm 365 nm})}\\), with increasing size indicated by smaller ratios (Haan 1972, 1993; Haan, Boer, and T 1987). To determine \\(a_Y\\) from clearer (e.g. oceanic) waters, a cuvette with a 10 cm path-length is generally needed due to their low values of absorption.\nPhytoplankton can contribute to the attenuation of PAR through absorption by their photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll and pheophytin, but they can also cause scattering. The absorption by phytoplankton \\(a_P\\) is the sum of absorption by each pigment multiplied each by their concentrations. Due to the fact that many species of phytoplankton occur in aquatic environments and every species contains more than one pigment, it is more practicable to calculate the absorption by mean specific absorption coefficients for each different algal species separately. This has been done by Gege (1998) for freshwater Lake Constance in Germany and by Prieur and Sathyendranath (1981) for an oceanic environment. Besides these examples, there are other models for oceanic waters that use the specific in vivo absorption coefficient and concentration of chlorophyll-a, \\(a_{chl}^*\\) and \\(C_{chl}\\), respectively. Morel (1991) found that the power law \\(a_P = 0.06\\, a_{chl}^*\\, [C_{chl}]^{0.65}\\), which was first proposed by Prieur and Sathyendranath (1981), provided the best estimate of the absorption coefficient for his data set. \\(C_{chl}\\) is the concentration of chlorophyll-a in units of \\(\\mymu\\)g l\\(^{-1}\\). Figure [fig:Phyto:Abs] shows the specific oceanic chlorophyll absorption coefficient from Morel (1991) normalized to maximum absorption at 440 nm. Figure [fig:Phyto:Abs] also shows laboratory measurements of chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-b absorption3 after Frigaard, Larsen, and Cox (1996). Spectra for chlorophyll absorption, and that of various other photochemically-relevant substances, are also available in computer software such as PhotochemCAD4 (Du et al. 1998; Dixon, Taniguchi, and Lindsey 2005). The empirical model of Bricaud et al. (1995) parameterises the specific absorption coefficient from \\(C_{chl}\\). This model draws on extensive studies of more than 800 spectra to give \\(a_P^*(\\lambda) = A(\\lambda)[C_{chl}]^{-B(\\lambda)}\\) with positive empirical coefficients \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) depending on wavelength. The model incorporates both the package effect of phytoplankton cells and the effect of the varying pigment composition on absorption.\nThe particulate structure of phytoplankton cells causes scattering. The influence of phytoplankton on the total scattering coefficient depends on the other constituents of the water body. For water containing a low concentration of inorganic suspended sediment scattering is driven by the concentration of phytoplankton (as occurs in the open ocean). Gordon and Morel (1983) developed an empirical model, which directly correlates scattering with the pigment concentration of chlorophyll-a \\(C_{chl}\\) in units of \\(\\mymu\\)g l\\(^{-1}\\). The scattering coefficient of phytoplankton \\(b_P\\) in units of m\\(^{-1}\\) is given by \\[b_P(\\lambda) = B \\cdot [C_{chl}]^{0.62} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_0}{\\lambda}\\right) \\label{equ_bp_emp}\\] with \\(\\lambda_0=550\\) nm and \\(B=0.3\\) as mean values for oceanic waters dominated by phytoplankton. The equation ([equ_bp_emp]) is valid for a range of phytoplankton concentrations from 0.05 to 1 \\(\\mymu\\)g l\\(^{-1}\\). Gordon and Morel (1983) found that oceanic waters have a value of \\(B\\le 0.45\\). Higher values are used for other aquatic environments, for example turbid coastal waters. In coastal regions, Sathyendranath, Prieur, and Morel (1989) proposed that the scattering coefficient is indirectly proportional to absorption by phytoplankton: \\(b_P(\\lambda) \\propto 1/a_P(\\lambda)\\). The proportionality factor depends on the concentration of chlorophyll-a in the same manner as the scattering coefficient of equation ([equ_bp_emp]). Dekker (1993) investigated the contribution to scattering of each water constituent in inland waters5. He found that the composition of scattering particles was more variable in inland waters than in the ocean and it depended on the trophic state of the water and therefore on the distribution of organic and inorganic particulate matter. The scattering and backscattering coefficient of phytoplankton can be determined by \\(b_P(\\lambda)=b_P^*(\\lambda) \\cdot C_P\\) where the specific scattering coefficient of phytoplankton is \\(b_P^*\\). For lakes Dekker (1993) reported that the specific scattering coefficient of phytoplankton ranges from 0.12 to 0.18 m\\(^2\\)mg\\(^{-1}\\) at a wavelength of 550 nm. The specific scattering coefficients can be obtained by integrating the scattering phase function of the observed matter, here, phytoplankton. Extensive and commonly used measurements were done by Petzold (1977). Other functions can be found for example in Mobley (1994).\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nParticulate matter in water bodies consists of organic and inorganic material. The organic constituents are contained in phytoplankton cells or are fragments of dead plankton and faecal pellets of zooplankton. These parts are often called detritus. Inorganic particles include suspended mineral coming from inflows or resuspension at coastal regions. They mainly consist of quartz, clay, and calcite. There are only a few published values of the specific absorption coefficients of suspended particles in water from aquatic environments because they are difficult to separate into their individual constituent parts. A comparison of these values is given by Pozdnyakov and Grassl (2003). In general, absorption by all suspended particles in most water bodies is very low and it is negligible for inorganic particles. Roesler, Perry, and Carder (1989) produced the following relationship for absorption by detritus in coastal waters which is very similar that of CDOM: \\[a_X(\\lambda) = a_X(\\lambda_0) \\cdot {\\rm e}^{-s_X(\\lambda-\\lambda_0)} \\label{equ_adet}\\] with a mean value of \\(s_X=0.011\\) nm\\(^{-1}\\) and \\(a_X(\\lambda_0)=0.09\\) m\\(^{-1}\\) at \\(\\lambda_0=400\\) nm for their data. Particulate matter in general causes more scattering of irradiance than it absorbs. In coastal waters and freshwater, scattering is higher than in oceanic waters due to the additional presence of particles not related to phytoplankton. These particles come from suspended inorganic sediments of different sizes. Scattering is caused by differences in the refractive indices of the two materials (the water medium and the material of the particles) and are due to the ratio of particle size to wavelength. Different functions of scattering coefficients and phase functions are, for example, described by Mobley (1994). Especially turbid and coastal waters, or rivers and lakes, are dominated by large particles (\\(&gt;1\\) \\(\\mymu\\)m and a refraction index of 1.03). Therefore, the scattering coefficient of non-living particles \\(b_X\\) can be estimated while neglecting their size distribution and wavelength dependence. Thus, \\(b_X\\) is derived from \\(b_X(\\lambda) = b_X^* \\cdot C_X\\), with the concentration of the total suspended matter \\(C_X\\) and the specific scattering coefficients \\(b_X^*\\). Dekker (1993) gave example specific scattering coefficients of 0.23 to 0.79 m\\(^2\\) g\\(^{-1}\\) for different trophic states in lakes.\n\n\n6.3.4 Results and effects\nIn summary, after considering all the components that absorb radiation, in very clear non-productive oceanic waters blue-green wavelengths in the PAR spectrum dominate, whereas in highly-coloured, humic inland waters blue wavelengths are rapidly attenuated. In humic lakes, CDOM largely governs UV attenuation (e.g. Kirk 1994a, 1994b; Scully and Lean 1994; P. S. Huovinen, Penttilä, and Soimasuo 2003)), whereas in oceans (Smith and Baker 1979) and clear lakes containing low CDOM concentrations the contribution of phytoplankton to UV attenuation can be significant (Sommaruga and Psenner 1997). If very turbid water contains a large amount of inorganic particles, CDOM is bonded by calcium carbonate contained in the particles, and consequently the colour of the water returns to blue.\nThere is marked variation in the penetration of UV radiation among water bodies, and within a water body during the year. Global changes, such as climate warming and acidification (Schindler et al. 1996; Yan et al. 1996; Donahue et al. 1998) can lead to increased underwater UV penetration, likewise UV-B radiation itself which can positively affect its own penetration through the photodegradation of CDOM (Morris and Hargreaves 1997). Variation in the absorption properties of dissolved organic compounds with the seasons and according to their origin and molecular weight (Stewart and Wetzel 1980; Hessen and Tranvik 1998; Lean 1998), interferes with our estimation of UV penetration based on CDOM concentrations. Temporal changes in the absorption characteristics of CDOM have also been reported, with fresh CDOM being photochemically more active than older CDOM (Lean 1998). It is also notable that UV radiation has been shown to penetrate deeper in saline prairie lakes than in fresh waters of corresponding CDOM concentrations (Arts et al. 2000).\nEstimations of CDOM are relatively easy to perform and therefore often used for in situ and remote sensing measurements of optical properties. However, another parameter called dissolved organic carbon (DOC, in units of mg l\\(^{-1}\\)) is also useful to measure, since it is more interpretable for studies of carbon cycling and in the context of global change research. Kowalczuk et al. (2010), report that CDOM contributes approximately 20% to the total DOC pool in the open ocean and up to 70% in coastal areas. Unfortunately, on a global scale it has not yet been possible to make a direct link between CDOM and DOC due to the heterogeneous organic composition of CDOM. Until that connection is made, estimation of the universal bulk carbon-specific CDOM absorption coefficient, defined as the ratio of CDOM absorption to DOC concentration, remains almost impossible (Wozniak and Dera 2007), but at least there are good correlations between \\(a_Y\\) and DOC concentrations in coastal areas (Kowalczuk et al. 2010).\nAquatic organisms can be affected not only directly but also indirectly through UV-dependent changes in the surrounding water, e.g. through increased formation of photochemical reaction products such as singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. Especially in lakes with low DOC concentrations, photoenhanced toxicity of some environmental contaminants or release of complexed metals into the water can occur due to the photodegradation of organic matter (Zepp 1982; Palenik, Price, and Morel 1991; Hessen and Donk 1994; Arfsten, Schaeffer, and Mulveny 1996; Scully et al. 1997). Despite the potential for detrimental effects, the final impact of UV radiation on organisms may be mitigated by their protective and repair mechanisms (Karentz, Cleaver, and Mitchell 1991; Mitchell and Karentz 1993; Vincent and Roy 1993), which somehow also depend on certain wavelengths of irradiation. When evaluating the exposure of seaweeds to UV radiation, it should be taken into account that other factors, such as kelp canopies, can markedly reduce the PAR and UV radiation reaching their understorey. Furthermore, the underwater radiation received by seaweeds can be significantly altered depending on the tidal range (P. Huovinen and Gómez 2011). Phenolic compounds released from large brown algae into the surrounding water can also locally attenuate UV radiation.\nClassifications of water bodies based on their optical characteristics have been developed as general tools in order to allow comparisons between different water bodies. Jerlov (1976) traditional and widely-used classification of marine waters, based on their transmittance of irradiance at different wavelengths, recognizes three oceanic (I–III) and nine coastal (1–9) types of water body (Figure [fig:Jerlov]). Morel and Prieur (1977) classified ocean waters into two types based on their optically dominant components: (i) phytoplankton and their products dominate case-i waters, (ii) particles and dissolved coloured material dominate case-ii waters. The classification proposed by Kirk (1980) is principally suited to inland waters and is based on the spectral absorption of the soluble and particulate fractions. Kirk (1980) defined type G waters, in which CDOM is the dominant light-absorbing component, compared with type T, W and A waters, where tripton, water itself and phytoplankton dominate respectively. Beyond these scales, various other optical classifications have also been proposed (reviewed by Kirk 1994a; Hargreaves 2003).\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3.5 Modelling of underwater radiation\nFollowing Beer’s law (Equation [eq:Beer-Lambert]), for deep water (no reflection from bottom), radiance \\(L(\\lambda)\\) decreases exponentially with depth \\(z\\) in the water column: \\[L(z,\\lambda) = L(z=0,\\lambda)\\cdot\\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{a\\cdot z}{\\cos\\theta}} \\label{equ_beer}\\] alternatively written as \\[\\cos\\theta\\,\\frac{{\\rm d}L(z,\\lambda)}{{\\rm d}z} = -a\\cdot L(z,\\lambda) \\label{equ_dbeer}\\] \\(\\theta\\) is the zenith angle of the incoming (downwelling) radiance in water. Note that Eqs. [equ_beer] and [equ_dbeer] are only valid if the water column is homogeneous with depth and there are no scattering particles and internal sources of light in the water, i.e. no fluorescence, raman scattering, nor bioluminescence. Thus, calculation of actual radiative transfer in water (not under idealised conditions) is much more complicated and can only be solved approximately by using empirical, semi-analytical or computational models (Dekker 1993; Mobley 1994; Lee, Carder, and Arnone 2002; Albert and Gege 2006).\nThe radiative transfer equations [equ_beer] and [equ_dbeer] are valid for radiance \\(L\\), which represents the collimated beam from one specific direction. Due to their construction, radiance detectors do not measure a beam from an infinitely small solid angle, they have an aperture of typically one or two degrees. Other types of detectors sense light from more than one direction, they measure the entire sphere or hemisphere (for details see also section [sec:basic:concepts] on page ), by integrating the incoming radiance over all directions. Another useful relationship between irradiance and fluence rate can be obtained using the Gershun equation: \\[\\frac{\\rm d}{{\\rm d}z} E(z,\\lambda) = -a \\, E_0(z,\\lambda) \\label{equ_gershun}\\] If, for example, only the downwelling irradiance \\(E_d(z,\\lambda)\\) is measured or necessary for calculating radiative transfer, Equation [equ_dbeer] yields \\[\\frac{{\\rm d}E_d(z,\\lambda)}{{\\rm d}z} = -K_d\\cdot E_d(z,\\lambda) \\label{equ_downirr}\\] giving the diffuse attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance, \\(K_d\\). \\(K_d\\) is related to the total absorption \\(a\\) and scattering \\(b\\) as well as to \\(\\theta\\) and also the solar zenith angle \\(\\theta_s\\) (Kirk 1991; Albert and Mobley 2003). A practical and often-used method to estimate \\(K_d\\), and therefore the transparency of the water, is the Secchi disk test. The visibility of a submerged white disk can be correlated to downwelling diffuse attenuation (Tyler 1968). This and also the penetration depth \\(z_d\\) give useful information about the water body. The penetration of irradiance important for photosynthesis (primary production) is often expressed as the depth at which, for example, 1% or 10% of the value just below the water surface is reached. The depth, where 1% of PAR is reached, separates the euphotic zone from the aphotic zone. After Kirk (1994a), \\(z_d\\) can be obtained from \\(K_d\\): \\(z_d(1\\%) = 4.6/K_d\\) and \\(z_d(10\\%) = 2.3/K_d\\). In Figure [fig:Valdivia], an example of spectral attenuation of solar radiation at different depths, as well as the penetration depths of UV-B, UV-A radiation and PAR are given for coastal waters of the south-eastern Pacific Ocean (off the coast of Chile).\nA very useful tool to simulate spectral radiance and irradiance under water, depending on different concentrations of the water constituents or bottom depth and type, is called WASI (water colour simulator, (Gege 2004)). The software includes different analytical parameterisations and it can also be used for inverse calculations, i.e. for estimating optical properties and concentrations of water constituents from (remote sensing) measurements. The software program including the manual is available free of charge using an anonymous login at the ftp server ftp://ftp.dfd.dlr.de/pub/WASI. Other models, which include angular distributions of radiation under water are, for example, the Monte Carlo method (Prahl et al. 1989; Wang, Jacques, and Zheng 1995)6, HydroLight (technique described by (Mobley 1994)), or EcoLight-S (Mobley 2011).\n\n\n\n\nimage",

    "text": "6.4 UV radiation within plant leaves\nModelling of UV-B within plant leaves has not so far been successfully achieved. For empirical estimations of UV penetration two methods have mainly been used: fibre-optic measurements and UV-induced fluorescence. Neither of them is ideal and both give only partial information.\n\n6.4.1 Fibre-optic measurements\nThis method was introduced for visible light by T. C. Vogelmann and Björn (1984), and has been adapted for ultraviolet radiation by Vogelmann, Bornman and coworkers (Bornman and Vogelmann 1988; DeLucia, Day, and Vogelman 1992; Cen and Bornman 1993). The method cannot be used for absolute measurements due to uncertainties about the local conditions and the acceptance angle at the fibre tip, but it has yielded valuable comparisons between wavelengths and depth distributions of radiation. Fibre probes can be made more angle-independent (García-Pichel 1995), but then become too bulky for measurements inside plant leaves.\n\n\n6.4.2 UV-induced chlorophyll fluorescence\nThis method has so far only been employed by excitation and measurement at the leaf surface. It thus mainly monitors penetration of UV radiation through the epidermis into the chlorophyll-containing mesophyll, i.e. transmission through the epidermis (Figure [fig:Chl:fluorescence]). Chlorophyll fluorescence excited by blue light usually serves as a standard (Bilger et al. 1997; Bilger, Johnsen, and Schreiber 2001), more recently excitation by red light has also been used to avoid interference by anthocyanins (Goulas et al. 2004). The principle has been used in commercial instruments that assess the UV absorbance of the epidermis (Kolb et al. 2005; Goulas et al. 2004). The first portable instruments, UVA-PAM and Dualex FLAV used UV-A radiation for excitation rather than UV-B radiation, but now there is at least one instrument, Dualex HCA, measuring UV-B absorbance.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nIn principle, chlorophyll fluorescence could also be used for monitoring UV penetration in another way, by recording fluorescence in cross-sections of leaves, as has already been done for the penetration of visible light (T. C. Vogelmann and Han 2000; T. C. Vogelmann and Evans 2002; Gould et al. 2002).\n\n\n6.4.3 Factors affecting internal UV levels\nMany studies have indicated that UV-absorbing compounds in the vacuoles of epidermal cells have a major role in regulating internal UV levels. However, absorbing compounds located in cell walls and other cell parts can also be important in controlling internal UV penetration. These compounds are usually not easily extractable, and consequently one cannot rely on extracts alone when judging the effectiveness of UV-screening protection. Furthermore, both wax deposits and pubescence may be very important for protection against ultraviolet radiation (Karabourniotis and Bornman 1999; Holmes and Keiller 2002). The amount of protection can also vary over time, even during the day, probably as a result of changes in flavonoid concentrations (Barnes et al. 2008; Veit et al. 1996). Of course leaf properties conferring protection also depend on environmental factors, in particular prior UV-B exposure, and great differences exist among plant species.",

    "text": "6.5 Action and response spectra\nPlants do not respond equally to all wavelengths of , and this spectral response can be described by a response spectrum and/or by an action spectrum. It is important to be aware that an action spectrum is not the same thing as a response spectrum. Although they are both used to describe the wavelength dependency of a biological response to radiation they are measured and used differently. Because they are measured in different ways they yield curves of different shapes. A response spectrum shows the size of the response at a fixed photon fluence7 of radiation across a series of different wavelengths. However, since UV radiation never comes at fixed irradiances over the entire spectrum the response spectrum is of limited use when estimating the physiological response to solar- or broadband UV exposure. In contrast, an action spectrum shows the effectiveness of radiation of different wavelengths in achieving a given size of response. This is a very important difference because dose response curves are not necessarily parallel or linear.\nWhen estimating biologically effective irradiances (see section [sec:BSWFs:UVeff] on page ) it is very important to use appropriate action spectra for each biological process. However, since the action spectra of many biological responses are not known, this provides a dilemma for researchers who must try to chose the action spectrum that best approximates the process they are studying. Using the wrong action spectrum can produce very large errors when predicting effective irradiance and, therefore, UV effects on plants due to e.g. ozone depletion (Rundel 1983; Cullen and Neale 1997). This is also a good reason for continued efforts to measure action spectra.\nBuilding a response spectrum is fairly simple; we need to measure a plant response at a single (photon) irradiance (or fluence) for each wavelength (or narrow band), whereas for constructing an action spectrum ones needs to measure the response at several different photon fluence values for each wavelength of interest.\n\n6.5.1 Constructing a monochromatic action spectrum\nAction spectra are most frequently measured using monochromatic light, i.e. radiation of a single or narrow range of wavelengths. This can be achieved by the use of systems which transmit, or emit, only a defined and usually narrow range of wavelengths, e.g. band-pass filters, LEDs, spectrographs, or lasers (see Chapter [chap:manipulating] for details about radiation sources). It is also possible to build, for example, an UV action spectrum with background irradiation of other wavelengths such us PAR.\nShropshire (1972) describes in detail the theory behind monochromatic action spectra, and the assumptions needed for an action spectrum to match the absorption spectrum of a photoreceptor pigment. He also considers the problem of how screening by other or the same pigments can distort the shape of action spectra. He gives examples for visible radiation but the theoretical considerations are fully applicable to ultraviolet radiation.\nTo construct a true action spectrum we first need to measure dose response curves for radiation of different wavelengths (Figure [fig:construct:action:spectrum]). The more curves we measure and the narrower the wavelength range used for each of these, the more spectral detail will be visible in the action spectrum built from them. For each of these curves, we should use a range of photon fluences yielding response sizes going from relatively small responses to close to the maximum response size (close to saturation). The photon fluence values used should increase exponentially. Photon fluence can be varied both by varying irradiance and/or irradiation times. If irradiation time is varied, it should be checked that reciprocity holds8. We fit a curve to each set of dose response data, using the logarithm of the photon fluence as an independent variable. Using a logarithmic scale is expected to yield a more linear response curve than untransformed photon fluence values. From the fitted dose-response curves we calculate by interpolation the photon fluence required at each measured wavelength to obtain a response of the selected target response size. We use the photon fluence values to calculate effectiveness as \\(1/ (\\pfd \\cdot t)\\) where fluence is given by the product of photon irradiance () by the irradiation time (\\(t\\)), and we finally plot these effectiveness values against wavelength (\\(\\lambda\\)). If the dose response curves are not parallel, the shape of the action spectrum will depend on the target response level chosen. Different causes have been suggested for the lack of parallelism of dose response curves that is sometimes observed. Two of these suggestions are self-screening effects and involvement of two or more interacting pigments in the response (Shropshire 1972). One can in principle use either quantum (=photon) or energy units, but quantum units are preferable as for any photochemical reaction absorption events always involve quanta. The shape of the spectrum will depend on whether an energy or photon basis is used.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nAs the main feature of interest is the shape of the curve, UV action spectra are usually normalized to an action that is equal to one at 300 nm. This is achieved, by dividing all the quantum (or photon) effectiveness values measured at different wavelengths, by the effectiveness at 300 nm. The use of \\(\\lambda =300\\) nm is an arbitrary convention, of rather recent adoption, so you will find, especially in the older literature, other wavelengths used for the normalization.\nA response spectrum will rarely match the absorption spectrum of the photoreceptor because of non-linearities in later steps between light absorption by the photoreceptor and an observed response. In the case of action spectra, by keeping the size of the response constant across wavelengths we attempt to minimize the effect of these non-linearities on the measured spectrum. Because of this, a properly measured action spectrum will usually closely follow the absorption spectrum of the pigment acting as photoreceptor, except from possible effect from interfering pigments. Figure [fig:action:spectra] and Table [tab:action:spectra] show several action spectra relevant to research on the effects of UV on plants. See the article by Gorton (2010) for a deeper discussion on biological action spectra.\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.5.2 Constructing a polychromatic action spectrum\nMonochromatic action spectra are useful to understand the nature of a specific response, e.g. damage, but are not suitable for calculating real effects under solar radiation. The response of a plant to light and UV radiation depends on both the amount of energy (dose-response) and the spectral composition of the radiation. Polychromatic action spectroscopy is based on a background of broad-band white light from artificial sources or natural daylight supplemented by various wavelength, for example between 280 and 360 nm (Holmes 1997). This polychromatic approach provides an action spectrum useful for assessing effects of UV under normal plant growing conditions, because the simultaneous exposure to a broad wavelength interval has a different net effect than that of an exposure to separate monochromatic radiation, due to synergisms or antagonisms between complex chemical and biological processes, for example repair mechanisms (Coohill 1992; Madronich 1993). In practice, such a realistic polychromatic radiation spectrum is achieved using a series of cut-off filters, which cut off radiation of wavelengths shorter or longer than a certain wavelength. The effect of such filters can be compared to the effect of the variable thickness of the stratospheric ozone layer. Figure [fig:Poly:Spectra] shows examples of spectral irradiance for broad band light from lamps filtered by different cut-off filters. The cut-off wavelength usually refers to the wavelength of 50% transmission.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nThe original approach, so called differential polychromatic action spectroscopy, is described by Rundel (1983). Different biological responses are proportional to different specific treatments, for example exposures. Thus, an action spectrum can be estimated by quantifying differences in responses between successive treatments. The number of treatments required depends on the relative change in response over a wavelength interval. One example of a quantifiable effect would be change in the observed concentrations of flavonols.\n\n6.5.2.1 The mathematics behind polychromatic action spectra\nThe average proportionality \\(\\overline{s}\\) between differences in the biological effective response of successive treatments \\(i\\), \\(\\Delta W_{be,i}\\), and differences in exposure (fluence rate multiplied by exposure time), \\(\\Delta\\exposure[i]\\) is given by an average quantity \\[\\overline{s_i} = \\frac{\\Delta W_{be,i}}{\\Delta\\exposure[i]}\\] All the values of \\(\\overline{s_i}\\) together are represented in the action spectrum. If the wavebands of each treatment are small enough, an action spectrum \\(s(\\lambda)\\) can be expressed by a mathematical function. Different functions are discussed (Rundel 1983; Cullen and Neale 1997). In the simplest case the factors \\(\\overline{s_i}\\) are positive and decrease exponentially with increasing wavelength. Thus, one common form of \\(s(\\lambda)\\) is \\[s(\\lambda) = \\mathrm{e}^{-k(\\lambda-\\lambda_0)} \\label{Equ:BSWF:exp}\\] where \\(k\\) is a parameter, which has to be obtained for each different biological effect using a fitting procedure, and a wavelength \\(\\lambda_0\\), where the action spectra are normalised to unity, e.g. \\(\\lambda_0=300\\) nm. Other functions including a polynomial dependence on \\(\\lambda\\) are also possible and perhaps necessary for describing complex mechanisms.\nFor the interpretation of the experimental data, the biological effective response \\(W_{be}\\), it is necessary to consider the wavelength dependency. Thus, it is crucial that the entire spectral irradiance \\(\\irr(\\lambda,t)\\) during the experiment is known. Broad-band meters are not suitable in most cases. This dependency is included in the biological effective dose function (exposure) \\(\\exposure[be]\\), given by\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\exposure[be] & = & \\int_\\lambda \\int_t \\enspace s(\\lambda) \\cdot \\irr(\\lambda,t) \\enspace{\\rm d}t\\enspace{\\rm d}\\lambda \\nonumber \\\\\\nopagebreak\n& = & \\int_\\lambda \\enspace s(\\lambda) \\cdot \\exposure(\\lambda) \\enspace{\\rm d}\\lambda \\label{Equ:Dose:be}\n\\end{aligned}\\] A mathematical model can separate wavelength and dose dependency for a set of experimental data by the use of mathematical functions describing \\(W_{be}(\\exposure[be])\\) and optimisation procedures, e.g. non-linear curve fitting (Cullen and Neale 1997; Ghetti et al. 1999; Ibdah et al. 2002; Götz et al. 2010). The model assumes that photons at different wavelengths act independently, but with different quantum efficiency at the same absorption site, and therefore with the same mechanism. Regarding the shape and saturation of the observed effect, different functions can describe the data of \\(W_{be}(H_{be})\\), for example a linear, hyperbolic or sigmoid function. A simple linear relation is \\[W_{be}(\\exposure[be]) = W_0 \\cdot \\exposure[be] \\label{Equ:Response:lin}\\] with the parameter \\(W_0\\), which has to be determined by the fitting procedure. If for example the exposure time of the radiation is constant and, therefore, not depending on the duration of the experiment \\(t\\), the combination of Eqs. [Equ:BSWF:exp] to [Equ:Response:lin] yields \\[W_{be}(\\exposure[be]) = W_0 \\cdot t \\cdot \\int_\\lambda \\enspace \\mathrm{e}^{-k(\\lambda-\\lambda_0)} \\cdot \\irr(\\lambda) \\enspace{\\rm d}\\lambda \\label{Equ:Response:lin2}\\] To solve the equation for the unknown parameters \\(W_0\\) and \\(k\\), measurements of the biological response \\(W_{be}\\) and the spectral irradiance \\(\\irr(\\lambda,t)\\) have to be put into a fitting routine, to optimise \\(W_0\\) and \\(k\\) by minimising the differences, e.g. the (root) mean square, between measured and modelled values of \\(W_{be}\\). In Figure [fig:Poly:Spectra] are six different scenarios shown. In this case, the differences among six individual measured and modelled responses have to be calculated and the sum of these needs to be minimised by a non-linear optimisation technique, such as that provided by the add-in “Solver” in Excel.\n\n\n\n6.5.3 Action spectra in the field\nUnder field conditions it is more difficult to build UV action spectra, and most frequently what are measured are polychromatic action spectra (e.g. Keiller, Mackerness, and Holmes 2003; Cooley et al. 2000).\nAs many whole-plant responses result from a long signal transduction chain, which depends on the action of more than one photoreceptor, the action spectrum for many responses at the whole-plant or organ level, seems to vary among species, with the seasons of the year or growing conditions. For responses like these it is almost impossible to define a unique and stable action spectrum for plants growing outdoors, as these responses are too far decoupled from the photoreceptors.\nEven if they do not faithfully reflect the properties of a single photoreceptor, action spectra can be extremely useful, as we need them as BSWFs (BSWFs) when calculating biologically effective UV doses (see section [sec:BSWFs:UVeff] on page ), since the same UV radiation spectrum has a different effect on different plant responses (Figure [fig:action:spectra]).",

    "text": "6.7 Appendix: Calculation of polychromatic action spectra with Excel (using add-in “Solver”)\nThis is an example of one possibility to derive the parameters of a polychromatic action spectrum by non-linear optimisation as explained in section 1.8.2 on page . The Excel add-in “Solver” is listed in the menu “Tools”. If this is not the case, it has to be installed in Tools&gt;Add-Ins. This experiment was performed in the small sun simulator of the Helmholtz Zentrum München, Neuherberg, Germany (see section [sec:simulators] at page ) in a special cuvette, which allows simultaneous exposure of plants under different radiation (Ibdah et al. 2002; Götz et al. 2010). Figure [fig:Sosi:Cuvette] shows the cuvette placed in the sun simulator with five rows of glass filters from Schott, Mainz, Germany (WG295, WG305, WG320, WG335, WG360).\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nAt the beginning we have to put all our measured data into different sheets in Excel. In this example, the biological response \\(W_{be}\\) is the -induced flavonoid lutonarin (in \\(\\mymu\\)mol g\\(^{-1}\\) FW (fresh weight)) of the first leaf of the barley cultivar “Barke”. The amount was estimated by HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography). Three young plants in each of three independent experiments were harvested under six different scenarios, which spectral irradiances are shown in figure [fig:Poly:Spectra] in section 1.8.2 on page . The data are put into the first sheet “leaf data” and mean values and standard deviations for each scenario were calculated as illustrated in figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet1]).\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nThe second sheet “spectra” contains all measured spectra of the six different scenarios under the glass filters. For the calculation of a polychromatic action spectrum in the range it is recommended that the spectrum is measured using a double-monochromator system from 280 to 400 nm in steps of 1 nm. In this experiment, the irradiance was increased from the morning until noon and then decreased until the evening, to simulate natural variation in solar radiation. This was done in four steps as shown in the picture of the third sheet “daily exposure” in figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet3]. As an example, typical radiation data under the glass filter WG305, measured during the experiment, are presented in table [tab:App:Poly:Spectra:UV-PAR]. This sheet is only necessary to calculate the exposure time at each light level in seconds as shown in the marked cell F8. Sheet “spectra” contains the wavelengths in column A and all the 24 spectra (six scenarios and four light levels) from column B to Y.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLight level\n1\n2\n3\n4\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n\n0.152\n0.584\n1.135\n1.531\nW m\\(^{-2}\\)\n\n\n\n8.76\n19.78\n24.67\n38.74\nW m\\(^{-2}\\)\n\n\n\n114\n228\n256\n363\nW m\\(^{-2}\\)\n\n\nor\n537\n1073\n1198\n1692\n\\(\\mymu\\)mol m\\(^{-2}\\) s\\(^{-1}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nNow all sheets for input data are finished and the sheets for solving our system of equations has to be prepared. Therefore, the next sheet “weighted spectra” is filled with the information about the action spectrum function as shown in figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet4]. This sheet contains the calculation of the biological effective dose function \\(H_{be}\\) as presented in equation [Equ:Dose:be] on page . First, for the action spectrum \\(s(\\lambda)\\) an exponential function in chosen, as explained for equation [Equ:BSWF:exp] on page . Column A includes the wavelengths and column B the estimated value of the action spectrum using the parameter \\(\\lambda_0=300\\) nm of cell B4 and \\(k=0.200\\) nm\\(^{-1}\\) of cell B5 (marked red in figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet4]). This cell is only a link to cell B11 in the next sheet “SOLVER”. Because it is only the starting value of the optimisation procedure, the values of column B do not represent the real action spectrum. These values will change during optimisation. Below row 6, column D and the following columns (in this case to column AA) include the values of the action spectrum of column B multiplied by the spectral irradiances of each scenario and light levels of sheet “spectra”. Row 1 and 2 include the estimation of the doses. The cells in row 2 from column D and the following columns represent the integration over the wavelengths from 280 to 400 nm of each column beneath multiplied by the exposure time of the respective scenario and light level as previously calculated in the sheet “daily exposure”. Integration in Excel is done by adding the values of the cells regarding the wavelength step as shown for the marked cell D2 in figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet4]. Here it is 1 nm. To get doses in units of Ws m\\(^{-2}\\) (J m\\(^{-2}\\)), the sum is divided by a factor of 1000 because the spectral irradiances were measured in mW m\\(^{-2}\\) nm\\(^{-1}\\). The daily dose (in kJ m\\(^{-2}\\)) is then calculated in row 1 for each scenario by adding the four values of the light levels. These daily doses are now needed for further calculations in the next sheet “SOLVER”.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nThe sheet “SOLVER” as illustrated in figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solver0] includes the comparison of the measured and modelled data—as table and figure. The first five rows are a short explanation of the entire model. Especially row 5 contains the mathematical function describing the measured biological response \\(W_{be}\\), which was the flavonoid content of lutonarin in the first leaf of barley. Here, a sigmoid function was chosen, given by \\[W_{be} = \\frac{W_0}{1+\\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{\\exposure[be]-\\exposure[0]}{b}}} \\label{Equ:Response:sigmoid}\\] Using this function, the values of each scenario of row 15 were calculated. Therefore, the variable coefficients \\(W_0\\), \\(\\exposure[0]\\), \\(b\\), and \\(k\\) as well as their constraints from row 8 to 11 were used. Row 14 includes the mean values of each treatment derived in the first sheet “leaf data”. The squared differences of measured and modelled data are calculated in row 16 and added up in cell C17. All cells are now prepared and we can start to optimise our variable coefficients by minimising the value of cell C17. Thus, we mark this cell by clicking on it and choose from the menu Tools\\(&gt;\\)Solver. A new small window called “Solver Parameters” will appear as shown in the left part of figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solverparam]. Here, the target cell was C17 and the box for minimisation was checked. The optimisation was done by changing the cells B8 to B11 concerning all constraints listed in the sheet. By clicking on the button “Options”, another window will pop up, where the parameters for the optimisation algorithm are defined (right part of figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solverparam]). In this example, a non-linear Newton method was used. The parameters of the upper left part of the window define the number of iterations or the maximum time for calculation as well as the precision or tolerance of the result. After inserting the numbers and checking the necessary boxes, click “OK” to return to the window “Solver Parameters”. Here, the optimisation starts by clicking on “Solve”. After a while, the program returns a message if the search succeeded and by accepting, the result is written into the cells of sheet “SOLVER” chosen for changing.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final result for the data in this example is shown in figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solved]. The sum of the squared differences was minimised to 0.13. The left graph in the bottom of figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solved] shows two bars for each scenario, one for the measured leaf data of row 14 (yellow) and the other one for the modelled data of row 15 (purple). The result looks promising. The most important parameter regarding the action spectrum is \\(k=0.126\\) nm\\(^{-1}\\) in cell B11. This value was used to plot the actual action spectrum of this study in the upper right graph of figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solved]. Our action spectrum is valid for wavelengths between 280 and 400 nm, that interval which was chosen for integration in sheet “weighted spectra”.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nThis example describes just one possibility to solve a multi-variable and non-linear problem. For example, there is also a plugin available for Calc in OpenOffice.org. Therefore, if using Calc instead of Excel, the file NLPSolver.oxt9 has to be installed by the extension manager. Other search algorithms are used in this tool, but the result will be the same.\n\n\n\n\nAlbert, A., and P.

However, if the irradiation time is varied it is important to check that reciprocity holds. In other words, that the same fluence achieved through different irradiation times elicits the same size of response.↩︎\nReciprocity refers to the assumption that equal values of photon fluence achieved by irradiation differing in length and photon irradiance, but supplying the same total number of photons, are expected to elicit an identical response.↩︎\navailable from http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/project/NLPSolver.↩︎",
