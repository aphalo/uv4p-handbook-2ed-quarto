    "text": "10.1 Prediction and attribution vs. prediction and estimation\nData analysis can have two different aims prediction and attribution or prediction and estimation. In the first case, we test a hypotheses formulated a priori, assigning a significance to predictors. In the second case, we aim at estimating curves or surfaces that describe a relationship and possibly predict new yet unobserved cases. Traditional statistics are useful in both cases. Newer methods that rely on big data can be called “pure prediction algorithms”, e.g., neural nets, deep learning, random forests, and similar methods. These methods taken broadly are unsuitable for attribution, i.e., for hypothesis testing in scientific research (Efron 2020).\nThe guidelines given here for good experimental design have been formulated with particular consideration given to experiments based on the manipulation of the UV, VIS and NIR radiation environemnt. Nevertheless most of the principles behind these guidelines can be generally applied to the design of experiments.\nExperiments can be designed to test attribution (hypothesis testing), to estimate relationships between explanatory and response variables. In this second case we may be content to estimate the likely value of parameters given a model, or do model selection, estimating not only parameter values and their confidence, but also selecting based on data the formulation of the model.\nIn the case when attribution is the aim, we should be careful not to let our knowledge of the data influence the tested hypothesis[^35]. In the second case, model choice can to some extent depend on the data, but we should be aware that this a posteriori choice of a functional relationship, could make the P-values less strict and thus invalid for assigning attribution.\nFitting models, for attribution or estimation, is especially useful when the parameters of the model have a biological or physical interpretation. In the case of estimation, it is important to also obtain estimates of the reliability of the estimates of the parameters values. In other words, we need to present not only the fitted values, but also their confidence intervals, or at least their standard deviations.\nAll estimates of P-values are based on a comparison of the variation between differently treated experimental units, and the variation among equally treated experimental units[^36]. If we assign treatments objectively by randomization, we can expect that in the absence of a treatment effect, on average, there will not be more variation among differently treated units than between equally treated units. The quality of the estimates obtained for the magnitude of these sources of variation will depend on the number of replicates measured, on proper randomization, and on an adequate design being used to control known error sources. The remaining unaccounted variation among equally treated units is called experimental error.\nWhen using tests of significance one should be aware that the P-value will depend on both the size of the treatment effect and on the standard deviation of the estimate (e.g., standard error of the mean) which strongly depends on the number of replicates. In an experiment with hundreds of replicates one is very likely to detect treatment effects that are statistically-significant, even if these effects are too small to be of any biological significance. On the contrary, in an experiment with few replicates, one risks biologically-significant effects remaining undetected. One should never forget that a large P-value indicates only that we have been unable to demonstrate an effect of a treatment, rather than demonstrating that such an effect did not exist. Strictly speaking it is impossible to demonstrate that there is no effect. However, what we can do is to estimate the size of the smallest effect that our experiment could have detected. This can be done by means of ‘statistical-power analysis’ (see Cohen 1977; Quinn and Keough 2002, chap. 7).\nJohn W. Tukey (1991) has written:",

They asked “Are the effects of A and B different?” and they were willing to answer “no.”\nAll we know about the world teaches us that the effects of A and B are always different—in some decimal place—for any A and B. Thus asking “Are the effects different?” is foolish.\nWhat we should be answering first is “Can we tell the direction in which the effects of A differ from the effects of B?” In other words, can we be confident about the direction from A to B?

    "text": "10.2 Planning of experiments\nIt is very important to properly design and plan an experiment in advance of its execution. From a well planned experiment one gets more interpretable and reliable results, usually with less effort and expense, and even sometimes faster. Often, badly planned experiments can yield unreliable data or results that do not answer the intended objective of a study. There are too many examples in the scientific literature of badly designed experiments or invalid statistical analyzes leading to erroneous conclusions, and manuscripts submitted for publication are frequently rejected by journals on the basis of a poorly thought through design.",

    "section": "10.4 Experimental design",
    "text": "10.4 Experimental design\nAs discussed by Cox and Reid (2000), the most basic requirement for a good experiment is that the questions it addresses should be interesting and fruitful. Usually this means examining one or more well-formulated research hypothesis. In most cases the more specific the research question asked, the greater the chance of obtaining a meaningful result. Quoting J. W. Tukey “An approximate answer to the right problem is worth a good deal more than an exact answer to an approximate problem.”\nOnce the research hypothesis to test has been chosen:\n\nthe experimental units must be defined and chosen,\nthe treatments must be clearly defined,\nthe variables to be measured in each unit must be specified, and\nthe size of the experiment, in particular the number of experimental units, has to be decided.\n\nWhen we perform an experiment, we choose our experimental units and manipulate their environment by controlling the levels of a component factor within that environment (treatments). We then record the response of our experimental unit. Factors are groups of different manipulations of a single variable. Each of the distinct manipulations within a factor is called a level: e.g. in an experiment giving plants daily exposures to 0, 5, and 10 of , the factor is and it has three levels (0, 5, and 10 ). A factor can also be qualitative, e.g. a factor where the levels are different chemicals.\nQuestions detailing the steps:\n\nWhat is the purpose of the experiment? To which objective questions do we want to find answers?\nWhat treatment is to be applied? At what levels? Do we include an untreated control? Is there any structure within the treatments?\nWhat is the response to be observed and recorded? What is the nature of the observations?\nAre there other variables which could affect the response?\nHow big a difference in response is practically important? How big a difference in response should be detectable?\nHow many experimental units are appropriate and practical to use?\nHow do we organize the experiment? What, where, when, how, who...?\nHow will the data obtained be analyzed?\n\nIn addition to performing these steps, keep notes in a logbook of the experimental plan, and everything done during the experiment. This will allow you to go back and check if the design was sound and how faithfully it was followed. By noting any changes that were made we may remember something important to assist in the interpretation of the results, or an improvement to make to future experimental designs. If necessary, such notes will also allow for any future repetition of the whole experiment. See examples in Box [ex:stats:UVexp:design].\n\n\n\nPurpose: study the effect of solar radiation on the accumulation of flavonoids in silver birch seedlings.\nResponse observed: concentration of flavonoids in the upper epidermis of the leaf. Nature of observations: epidermal absorbance measured at 365 nm wavelength with a Dualex FLAV instrument. Sequential measurements once a week.\nTreatment: Solar attenuation using filters. Levels 10%, 50%, and 90% attenuation of .\nOther variables which could affect the response: age of seedlings, age and size of sampled leaf, soil type, temperature, rainfall, shading, time of application.\nNumber of experimental units: e.g. 5. Estimated based on item [Example:item:sizeof response] below.\nNumber of seedlings (subsamples) measured in each experimental unit: e.g. 20.\nHow do we organize the experiment? What seed provenance, size of pots, sowing date, fertilization date if any, watering frequency, filter frame size and height, soil used, how frequently to sample and when, who does all these things.\nData analysis: compute the mean epidermal absorbance for each experimental unit and date, and test for differences between treatments in an ANOVA for repeated measurements, accounting for any uncontrolled environmental gradients (as blocks or covariates).\nDifference in response that is practically important from a biological perspective: e.g. 0.3 absorbance units. Detectable difference: e.g. 0.2 absorbance units. []{#Example:item:sizeof response label=“Example:item:sizeof response”}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirements for a good experiment\n\n\n\nFollowing Cox (1958, chap. 1):\n\nPrecision. Random errors of estimation should be suitably small, and this should be achieved with as few experimental units as possible (a sort of cost/benefit analysis).\nAbsence of systematic error. Experimental units receiving different treatments should differ in no systematic way from one another (to avoid bias confounded with effects of interest).\nRange of validity. The conclusions should have as wide a range of validity as needed for the problem under study.\nSimplicity. The experiment should be as simple as possible in design and data analysis.\nAssessment of uncertainty. A proper statistical analysis of the results should be possible without making artificial assumptions. (The fewer and more plausible the assumptions are, the more credible results and conclusions will be.)\n\n\n\nIn practice we almost never have too many replicates in experiments, as the responses under study tend to be small compared to the random variation. For experiments, more frequently the problem at hand is how to make the most efficient use of the limited number of true replicates that we can afford. Good experimental design helps with this and helps us to assess the feasibility of experiments given a limited amount of resources. Fulfilling the requirements listed above will ensure that conclusions derived from experiments are valid.",

    "section": "10.5 The principles of experimental design",
    "text": "10.5 The principles of experimental design\nWe will consider three ‘principles’ on which the design of experiments should be based: replication, randomization, and grouping into blocks. Each of these principles ensures that one aspect of the design of an experiment is correct and increases the likelihood that it will yield data that can be statistically analyzed without need for unrealistic assumptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples of experimental design\n\n\n\n\nReplication \\rightarrow control of random variation \\rightarrow precision.\nRandomisation \\rightarrow elimination of systematic error.\nUse of blocks or covariates \\rightarrow reduction of error variation caused by experimental unit heterogeneity.\n\n\n\nIn the sections below we discuss each of these principles in turn and give examples of their application.\n\n10.5.1 Replication\nWhen an experiment is done several times, either simultaneously or sequentially, each time or repetition is a replicate. Replication serves several very important roles.\n\nReplication allows for estimation of the random variation accompanying the results. This random variation is called experimental error.\nReplication increases the precision with which the treatment effect is estimated, because each repetition gives additional information about the experiment. This can be appreciated from the equation relating the variance of the original population to that of the mean: \\sigma^2_{\\overline{x}} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}, where \\overline{x} is the mean, n the number of replicates, and where \\sigma^2 is the variance (of individual measurements) and \\sigma^2_{\\overline{x}} is the variance of the mean. The standard error of the mean is \\sigma_{\\overline{x}} = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2_{\\overline{x}}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} frequently abbreviated to s.e. or S.E.M.\n\n\n\n10.5.2 Randomization\nWhich treatment is applied to each experimental unit should be decided at random (if appropriate after forming blocks). The idea is to be objective. One should avoid any subjective or approximately random procedures, which would invalidate any statistical test based on the data collected from such an experiment. In addition to assigning treatments at random, other possible sources of bias should be avoided by randomization:\n\nThe order in which measurements are done in the different experimental units should be randomized. Never measure all the experimental units receiving one level of treatment together and then all those receiving another level of treatment together. If the design includes blocks, then do the measurements by block, with the order of the different levels of treatment assigned at random within blocks. Be particularly careful if using more than one machine of the same type to make sure that the machines have been cross-calibrated. Likewise, if more than one person is working on an experiment, test that both people use the same criteria for taking measurements by comparing their readings when measuring a subsample of the same experimental units.\nIf several treatments are applied to each experimental unit in a sequential design, the order in which they are applied should be randomized.\nEverything that can be randomized, should be randomized to avoid bias, and to ensure that the assumptions behind statistical tests of significance are fulfilled.\n\nRandomization is of fundamental importance because:\n\nIt allows the organization of an experiment to be objective.\nIt prevents systematic errors from known and unknown sources of variation, because when randomized, these sources of variation should affect all treatments equally ‘on average’. Randomization guarantees that the estimators obtained for the treatment effect and of the error variance are unbiased. This in turn allows valid conclusions to be derived from statistical tests.\n\n\n\n10.5.3 Blocks and covariates\nIn designs with blocks we arrange the experimental units into homogeneous groups (according to some important characteristics). Each of these groups is called a block. Treatments are randomized within the blocks, normally with all treatments present in each block at least once. If blocking is successful it decreases the error variance because the systematic variation between the blocks can be separately accounted for in the analysis. If blocking is not successful, the estimator of error variance is not significantly reduced, but has fewer degrees of freedom[^37].\nEvery effort should be made to use and retain a balanced design (i.e. blocks of the same size, and an equal number of replicates for all treatments) since this makes analysis and interpretation of results much simpler. There are sometimes advantages to the adoption of more complex (but still balanced) designs that use the same principles as blocking, but allocate treatments to groups based on more than one criterion. Examples of these are Latin square and Greco-Latin square designs. See Box [ex:stats:block].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\nIf the experimental units belong to two, or more, statistical populations, then the best option is to use a design that acknowledges this. Such populations could be distinct soil series, cultivars or even years.\nFor example if we have three different cultivars of a crop that are important in a certain region for which we want the conclusions from our experiment to be applicable, we need to include several experimental units for each of the cultivars. In this case, structure should be added by classifying the units into three blocks one for each cultivar. In this way the sensitivity of our test will not be affected by the additional variation due to cultivars, but the results will be applicable to the three of them, instead of just to one.\nIf we suspect that the cultivars may respond to UV differently, the appropriate design would be a factorial one, which would allow to assess this difference through the interaction term.\n\n\nEven if it is impossible to group the experimental units into homogeneous blocks, it may be possible to measure some relevant property of the experimental units before applying the treatments. Afterwards, this measured variable can be included as a covariate in an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), or linear mixed effects (LME) or non-linear mixed effects (NLME) model. This may improve the performance of the statistical tests, by accounting for some of the random variability among experimental units. In any case, one should be careful with interpretation of ANCOVA results (Cochran 1957; Smith 1957). Including a covariate in a model does not lessen the requirement for proper randomization.\nThe flowchart below summarizes the designs most suitable for different simple cases based on the characteristics of the experimental units.\n\n\n\nChoice of statistical design based on the type of variation among the available experimental units.",

    "text": "10.6 Experimental units and subsamples\nIt is very important to understand the difference between experimental units and subsamples. This is crucial because correct statistical analysis is only possible if we correctly identify the experimental units in our experiments. An experimental unit is the unit or ‘thing’ to which the treatment is assigned (at random) (e.g. a tray of plants). An experimental unit is not necessarily the unit that is measured, which can be smaller (e.g. a leaf from a treated plant). A measured object (= measurement unit) which is smaller than an experimental unit is called a subsample (or subunit).\nIn a simple design the experimental units are usually easy to identify. The same is true for non-hierarchical factorial designs (i.e. when the factors are not nested). However, in hierarchical designs, like split-plot designs, the experimental units for one factor may be nested within the larger experimental units used for another factor. In such a case, the error terms in an ANOVA will be different for the different factors, and will also have a different number of degrees of freedom. Another common situation occurs when treatments are applied to experimental units and the same units are measured or sampled repeatedly in time. In this case it is not appropriate to apply a factorial design, with time as one factor, in an ANOVA since this would assume that all observations are independent. Instead one should use a design that takes into account the correlation among the repeated measurements. See examples, and the flowchart for a summary of how the relationship between experimental and measurement units affects the data analysis.\n\n\n\nIn an experiment we grow three plants per pot. We have nine pots. The treatments are three different watering regimes, which are assigned to the pots. We measure photosynthesis on individual plants. We get three numbers per pot. The pots are the experimental units. The photosynthesis measurements from each plant are subsamples. The subsamples are not independent observations. The (random) assignment of the treatments was not done on the plants, so the plants are not experimental units. The treatments were assigned to the pots.\nn = 3, N = 9\nn is the number of true replicates. N is the number of experimental units in the whole experiment.\nIn an experiment we grow three plants per pot. We have nine pots. The treatments are three different foliar fertilizers, which are assigned (at random) to the plants within each pot. We measure photosynthesis on individual plants. We get three numbers per pot. The plants are the experimental units. The photosynthesis measurements from the plants are replicates. The three plants in each pot are not independent of each other. To account for this non-independence, the pots are treated as blocks in the statistical analysis. (Depending on the duration of the experiment and the differences in size between plants, in practice, using 27 pots with one plant per pot may be better.)\nn = 9, N = 27\nIn an experiment we grow one plant per pot. We have nine pots. The treatments are three different watering regimes, which are assigned (at random) to the pots. We measure photosynthesis on individual plants. We get one number per pot.

    "section": "10.7 Pseudoreplication",
    "text": "10.7 Pseudoreplication\nPseudoreplication involves the misidentification of the experimental unit as what is really the measurement unit, so giving a higher n than is truly the case. Examples of pseudoreplication are quite readily found in the scientific literature. In UV experiments pseudoreplication is particularly prevalent as researchers often mistake the plant for the lamp frame or filter as the experimental unit. Hurlbert (1984) was the first paper to bring this frequent problem of ecological research to light. Pseudoreplication is not just a small annoyance, it is a difficult problem in field experiments in ecology, and it frequently remains hidden within the Discussion and Conclusions sections of scientific papers. The most frequent scenario occurs when experiments are designed as a comparison of two typical experimental units but conclusions are applied to the whole population of units. In other words, conclusions are based on subsamples rather than on true replicates. Quinn and Keough (2002) describes this situation as a mismatch between the scale of treatments and the scale of replicates.\nPseudoreplication happens when subsamples are treated as replicates in the statistical analysis and interpretation.\nWhen an experiment is thoughtfully planned and the researcher is certain about the identity the unit of replication, it should be possible to avoid pseudoreplication. However, where an oversight in planning or logistics has made pseudoreplication unavoidable, the additional assumptions involved in the interpretation of any statistical tests must be clearly indicated in reports or publications arising from the study. See Box [ex:stats:pseudo] for examples of pseudoreplication and suggested ways of avoiding this problem.\n\n\n\nWe want to study the effect of radiation on the growth of plants. We have two rooms, one with only normal lamps supplying PAR and one with some lamps in addition to the normal lamps. We randomly assign 20 plants to each room. We measure the height of the plants after one week. This experiment has 20 subsamples per treatment, but only one replicate. (The treatments were assigned at random to the rooms, not to the plants). It is not valid to treat the subsamples as replicates and try to draw conclusions about the effect of radiation, since we have only pseudoreplicates. In this case pseudoreplication adds the implicit assumption that the only difference between the rooms was the irradiance. Our statistical test really only answers the question: did the plants grow differently in the two rooms?\nSeveral remedies are needed to obtain a wider range of validity from this experiment. Replicates in time can be created by repeating the experiment several times swapping the lamps between rooms. Such a situation is far from ideal because it is difficult to maintain plants and rooms in an equivalent state over time, since factors such as time of year and deterioration of lamps and filters must be accounted for. An additional step towards overcoming this problem would be to make a pre-experimental trial trying to create ‘identical’ conditions in both growth rooms and checking whether this results in any difference in plant performance.\nWe want to study the differences between high elevation and lowland meadow vegetation. We choose one typical lowland meadow (LM) and one high elevation meadow (HM). We establish 5 plots, located at random, within each meadow. In each plot we mark ten 1 m^2 sampling areas at random, and record the species composition within these areas.\nIt is not valid to try to answer the question ‘is species x more frequent in lowland meadows than in highland meadows’ using the plots as replicates, since we have only pseudoreplication. The context of the question posed is critical in this instance. For this question we have, one true replicate (one meadow of each type), 5 subsamples (the plots) within each meadow, and 10 subsubsamples within each subsample. If the experiment is performed as described, it can only answer the question: “Is species x more abundant in meadow ‘LM’ than meadow ‘HM’?” If we want to draw conclusions about the two (statistical) populations of meadows, we should sample at random from those populations. For example compare five different highland meadows to five lowland meadows.\nWe have three UV-B lamp frames. The radiation from the lamps in one frame is filtered with cellulose di-acetate, in another frame the lamps are filtered with polyester, and in the third frame the lamps are not energized. We chose at random three groups of 100 seedlings and put one group under each frame. This is an un-replicated experiment, we have one experimental unit (one lamp frame) per treatment. If we use the plants as replicates, we commit pseudoreplication. The plants are subsamples, not replicates.\nIdeally we would try to obtain more lamp frames. If this was impossible, a replicated experiment could be created by sub-dividing the area under each lamp frame into two separate parts, and allocating one half of each containing 50 seedlings to be filtered by cellulose di-acetate and the other half by polyester. The unenergised lamp treatment would have to be omitted, but this compromise would enable three replicates of the two treatments to be created. Each lamp frame would be a block.\nWe have nine UV-B lamp frames, three for each treatment. We put 100 plants under each frame as above. We do the statistical analysis based on the measurements on each plant considering the plants as replicates, we commit pseudoreplication. Our estimate of the error variance is wrong, as it does not reflect the variation among frames with the same treatment, and degrees of freedom are hugely inflated. \nAlternatively, we do the experiment exactly as in the item above, but we calculate means per frame for the measured variable, and then use these means in the statistical analysis. In other words we analyse our data using the frames as replicates. We have a valid test of significance, because the error variance reflects the variation between equally treated experimental units (the lamp frames). Logistical constraints often require that a decision must be made about whether to measure more plants under fewer replicates, or fewer plants under more replicates. When such a compromise has to be made, it is nearly always preferable to have more experimental units and to measure fewer plants within each one, even at the expense of greater allocation of time and resources to the maintenance of filters and lamp frames.",

    "section": "10.8 Range of validity",
    "text": "10.8 Range of validity\nThe range of validity of the conclusions of an experiment derives from the population upon which the experiment was performed. These conclusions can not be extrapolated beyond the statistical population from which the experimental units were randomly chosen. The wider the range of validity, the more generally applicable the information obtained from an experiment will be. If we wish to perform an experiment with broad applicability we can increase the breadth of the sampled population, but in doing so we run the risk of having more heterogeneous experimental units. This can make treatment effects more difficult to detect, unless we take special measures to control this error variation.\nIf we do an experiment with only one inbred variety of a crop species the results and conclusions will apply only to that variety. If we mix the seeds from several varieties and assign the plants at random to the treatments, we enlarge the range of validity of the results and conclusions but we increase the random variation. We can control for this increase in variation by using several varieties as blocks. In this way, we increase the range of validity of the results and conclusions without increasing the random variation.\nThe design of an experiment involves many compromises concerning its range of validity, these relate to trade-offs between generality, precision, and realism, not to mention cost.\n\n10.8.1 Factorial experiments\nOne way of increasing the range of validity of the results of a scientific study is to use a factorial design for an experiment. For example, if we study the effects of radiation on well-watered plants only, then the conclusions of our study will be valid only for well-watered plants. If we include a second factor in our design with three levels, ‘drought’, ‘mild drought’ and ‘well watered’ and include all the treatment combinations possible, e.g. based on the three levels of watering and three levels of attenuation we have nine treatments and the range of validity is greatly expanded. In addition we can statistically test whether these two factors interact[^38]. Factorial experiments are a very powerful and useful design but if too many factors and levels are included their interpretation may become difficult. Factorial experiments with many factors and/or levels result in a statistical analysis based on many different contrasts[^39]. In this case, we should remember that in most analyzes we wish to obtain P-values per contrast, rather than per experiment. If we want to keep the experiment-wise risk level constant, we should use a tight contrast-wise risk level, or adjust the P-values.\nThe flowchart below describes the relationships between the structure of treatments and suitable methods for tests of significance.\n\n\n\nChoice of type of model fitting or statisitical test of significance based on the design of the experiment and approaches used for treatment assignment or randomization.",

    "text": "10.9 When not to make multiple comparisons\nIn the biological literature, multiple comparison procedures such as Tukey’s HSD are frequently used in situations where other tests would be more effective and easier to interpret. In some other cases multiple comparisons are used in situations in which they give misleading results. We will discuss the two most common cases of misuse of these tests.\n\n10.9.1 Dose response curves\nIf we have several levels of the same treatment, for example several different irradiances of UV, the most powerful (capable of reliably detecting effects) test is to fit a regression (either linear or non-linear) of the response on the “dose”. From such an analysis we get information on the relationship between dose and response, whether it is increasing or decreasing, linear or curvilinear, even its shape can be inferred. In many cases we can also calculate a confidence band around the fitted function. This is all useful and interpretable information.\nIf instead we calculate for example HSD or LSD and compare the responses to all possible pairs of doses, we discard the information about the ordering of the doses, and we can get results that do not address our research hypothesis, for example, concluding that all pairs of adjacent doses do not differ significantly while the extreme doses do differ significantly. In this type of experiments we are really interested in the slope and shape of a dose response curve.\nMultiple comparisons should be carried out only when there is no ordering in the levels of a treatment of factor. A regression or ANCOVA model should be used instead, if a reasonable model can be fitted.\n\n\n10.9.2 Factorial experiments\nFactorial experiments are very useful and as discussed above allow extending the range of validity of our conclusions. However, the main advantage of factorial experiments is that the significance of interactions can be tested. The most important part of the statistical analysis of a factorial experiment is an ANOVA with a model including main effects and interactions. Only after this test, one can in addition, test the differences among different pairs of treatments. This a posteriori test provides little extra information and should be done only if the interaction term is statistically significant. Otherwise, if the levels of a factor are discrete and unordered, and its main effect is significant in ANOVA, a multiple comparison test can be used to compare the levels of a factor (but not the individual combinations of levels of the different factors).",

In such designs, it is especially important to indicate which error term the error bars in figures show. In all cases, the figure and table legends should state which statistics are depicted by the error bars, and also the number of replicates involved in their calculation.\nIf what one wants to describe is the variability in the original sampled population then one should use the standard deviation (s.d.), whose expected value does not depend on the number of replicates.

    "text": "10.11 \nIn this section we list recommendations related to the statistical design of experiments for studying the effects of radiation on plants. See sections 8.6.1 and 8.6.2 for recommendations on manipulation of radiation, section 9.15 for recommendations on how to quantify radiation, and section 10.9 for recommendations about plant growing conditions.\n\nAvoid pseudoreplication. In most experiments where irradiance is manipulated either with lamps or filters, individual plants or pots are not true replicates. The true replicates are the lamp- or filter frames. Design your experiments and analyze your data taking this into account.\nAvoid pseudoreplication. In experiments under controlled conditions, if treatments are assigned to chambers or rooms, these chambers or rooms are the true replicates, not the plants within them. To have true replicates you will need several rooms per treatment. When this is not possible, the experiment can be repeated in time, using the same chambers or rooms, but reassigning the treatments, so that each chamber is used for a different treatment in each iteration of the experiment.\nInclude enough true replicates in your experiment. Many effects of radiation are small in relation to the mean and subtle in comparison to natural levels of variability. Reliably detecting these effects requires well-replicated experiments.\nAs a rough rule of thumb, aim at having at least 32 plants per treatment for growth, ecophysiology and metabolite measurements, in at least four true replicates composed each of eight measured plants in controlled environment and greenhouse studies. When making gas-exchange readings, it is usually impractical to measure from more than four to six plants in each of the four true replicates. If you aim to make an ecologically-orientated outdoor study it would be advisable to have at least five true replicates. In addition to issues of replication, in most cases you will need to have unmeasured border plants surrounding your experimental plants so as to avoid edge effects. Alternatively the positions of plants can be rotated every few days.\nPreferably use a design with blocks to control all known or expected sources of error (or background variation) that would otherwise confound the treatment effects. Examples of such sources of variation are different benches in a greenhouse, or measurements done by different observers. If you suspect that a known source of error may interact with your UV treatment, you may decide to consider it as a covariate in your model.\nWithin the blocks, use randomization to neutralize the effects of other error sources. Randomization is of fundamental importance and should be done properly: i.e. a device that generates a truly random assignment of treatments to experimental units should be employed. Such devices can be as simple as a coin, or die, or can be a table of random numbers in a book, or (pseudo-) random numbers generated by a computer or a pocket calculator.\nWhen designing an experiment use power analysis to determine the number of replicates needed, unless you have a long experience of performing similar experiments, and a good existing understanding of the amount of variability you expect to find in your results.\nIf your experiment yields a non-significant difference, use a posteriori power analysis to demonstrate, if possible, that biologically important differences would have been detected had they existed. However, if power analysis reveals that your experiment was unable to detect biologically important differences, you should repeat the experiment with more replicates or an improved design.",

Expressions such as “light intensity” and “amount of light”, which are ambiguous, must be avoided. In addition, ambiguity must be also avoided in equipment specifications and management recommendations targeted at growers and other stakeholders. They depend on the information provided as a basis for decisions affecting the success of their activities or even the succesful implementation of government policies.\nInstruments used to measure the properties of radiation are imperfect. All measurements are subject to errors and uncontrolled variation. Some of this variation is inherent to the individual instrument, including bias. However, variation also occurs in response to other variables in the environment such as temperature and humidity. In addition, the radiation-detectors used in some sensors as well as electronic components used in the circuits that amplify and record the measured quantities, age, i.e., their properties change with time. Thus,to ensure accuracy and reproducibility, recalibration of instruments at regular intervals is a must.\nHow the instruments are used, i.e., consistently following a correct measurement protocol together with good awareness of the limitations of the equipment are unavoidable requirements for accurate and reproducible measurements of all properties of radiation.\nA comprehensive glossary of terms relating to visible and ultraviolet radiation has been published by Braslavsky (2007). It can be downloaded from the Internet (see link in reference list).\nAfter an introduction to the different types of instruments and discussing generic features of measurement protocols including some caveats, the remaining of this chapter is organized by physical and biologically relevant quantities, starting from those covering the widest range of wavelengths. For each quantity commonly used sensors and instruments are described together with specific measurement protocols and common errors and pitfalls affecting them.

    "text": "Accuracy and precision of radiation measurements\n\n\n\nIt is important to consider in each situation what are the required accuracy and precision. When estimating changes in irradiance over long periods of time, instrument calibration drift is the most important source of bias. When comparing measurements done with different instruments, the accuracy of their calibrations and possible bias introduced by extraneous variables such as temperature are most important. These are the hurdles that meteorologists most frequently have to deal with.\nIn a biological experiment were the different light conditions are measured with the same broadband sensor, the main consideration is whether the calibration of the instrument is valid under each light condition. When measuring a light source at near range (up to several meters), using the correct distance between source and sensor becomes crucial. When small differences among conditions are more important that absolute values, precision is more important than accuracy.\nExtraneous shading and reflections by objects and by the operator during measurements can introduce very large errors haphazardly. Poor levelling of diffusers, and in permanent installations, soiling of diffusers can also become important sources of bias.\nReplication in time and space are needed to quantify real-world variation. On the other hand, the accuracy of calibrations is reported in calibration certificates. This accuracy applies only to the calibration itself under the conditions under which it was done, and weakens with differences in temperature and with time. Sensor specifications sometimes include a description of the dependency on temperature and in most cases recommended annual or bi-annual recalibration.\nIt is also important to keep in mind that many instruments reach rated accuracy only after a warming-up period. This applies also to artificial light sources, including LEDs. They should be measured only after their temperature is stable and obviously at the same temperature as when used.\nIt is worrying that in biological research these points are rarely taken into full consideration, and almost never described in the methods section of publications.",

    "section": "6.2 Spectroradiometers",
    "text": "6.2 Spectroradiometers\nSpectroradiometers measure spectral irradiance, usually expressed in \\mathrm{W\\,m^2\\,nm^{-1}} or equivalent units differing only by a scaling factor, e.g., \\mathrm{mW\\,cm^2\\,nm^{-1}}. The wavelength resolution of spectrometers can vary from a fraction of a nanometre to a few tens of nanometres. What distinguishes data obtained with a spectroradiometer is that radiation over a wide range of wavelengths is quantified at each of many (\\gg\n100) contiguous narrow wavelength “slices” or bands. Spectroradiometers are spectrometers with entrance optics that makes it possible to measure irradiance or, exceptionaly, fluence rate.\nSpectrometers fall into two main groups: array spectrometers based on an array of detectors and a single static monochromator grating, and scanning spectrometers based on a single detector and one or two moving monochromators. Within each approach there are different types of detectors in use, different types of monochromators, and different optics. However, in some respects array and scanning spectrometers are fundamentally different.\nIn array spectrometers the monochromator projects radiation of different wavelengths onto different sensors arranged as a linear (1-dimentional) array. Thus, the whole spectrum is measured simultaneously. In a scanning spectrometer, the moving grating projects the radiation of different wavelengths sequentially onto the same and only sensor. Thus, radiation at each wavelength “slice” is measured at a different point in time.\nScanning spectroradiometers a based on a mechanism that accurately moves the manochromator(s) in very small steps, in most cases motorised. Mechanical accuracy and sturdiness depend a rigid, and heavy structure. For this reason, scanning spectrometers are in general much bigger and heavier, and, thus, more difficult to transport than array detector spectroradiometers. They are also less tolerant to rough handling and usually require mains power. However, scanning spectrometers can accomodate a double monochromator arrangement. The two monochromators are “in series” such that the light beam passes through both of them before reaching the sensor. This improves markedly the separation of light of different wavelengths reaching the sensor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe term spectrometer is used to indicate that the same instrument, depending on its attachments and calibration, can be also used to measure spectral absorbance, -transmittance, or -reflectance, in addition to spectral irradiance.\n\n\n\n6.2.1 Scanning spectroradiometers\nTHIS SECTION FOCUSES MAINLY ON THE SPECTRORADIOMETERS USED FOR LONG TIME SERIES OF UV MEASUREMENTS IN METEOROLOGY. IT ONLY MENTIONS IN PASSING SCANNING SPECTRORADIOMETERS FREQUENTLY USED BY BIOLOGISTS. THIS SECTION NEEDS SOME EXPANSION AND REORGANIZATION. MENTION OR MANUAL INSTRUMENTS NOW NO LONGER USED, COULD HOWEVER, WORK AS AN INTRODUCTION AS THEY ARE SIMPLER WHILE BASED ON THE SAME PRINCIPLES. e.g. LI-COR LI-1800 from 1980’s and ISCO SR from 1970’s.\n\n6.2.1.1 Basic structure and principles of operation\nThe basic components of a scanning spectroradiometer designed for fixed installation outdoors are: a) input optics for collecting radiation from the sky and guiding it further into the spectroradiometer b) a monochromator for resolving the input radiation into separate wavelengths c) a photomultiplier tube (PMT) or a solid state detector for sequentially quantifying the energy in each spectral component of the measured radiation. In addition, scanning spectroradiometers in most cases need to be used tethered to a personal computer or tablet as they usually lack a built-in screen for user interface or enough memory for data storage. EXAMPLE SPECTRORADIOMETER is needed here!! Biospherical and Brewer.\nThe input optics typically consist of a flat PTFE (“Teflon”) diffuser disk covered by a quartz dome. The diffuser collects the incident photons from the overhead hemisphere. The resulting diffuse radiation is guided to the entrance slit of the monochromator, sometimes by means of an optical fibre. The monochromator may be a single or a double monochromator (see section spectrographs). In scanning spectroradiometers, a system based on a step motor drives a mask that allows only photons of a certain wavelength at a time to enter the exit slit of the monochromator. The exit slit serves as the entrance window to the cathode of the PMT. The photon pulses are amplified and transmitted to a photon counter for registration.\nWhile most frequently irradiance is measured on a plane parallel to the ground, to measure “normal solar irradiance” spectroradiometers can be mounted on a solar tracker that follows the position of the sun maintaining the plane of the diffuser facing directly into the sun. A measurement head at the end of an optical fibre may be also installed on a separate sun tracker. The temperature of the instrument is usually either stabilized or kept above a certain temperature limit to ensure proper functioning. The dome of the measurement head may be equipped with a heater and/or air blower to keep the temperature of the teflon within certain limits and to avoid formation of frost or dew on the dome surface.\nScanning spectroradiometers intended for laboratory or spot measurements outdoors are smaller and less rugged. They are more portable but more sensitive to temperature extremes and are not water proof. Examples of such instruments are Optronics OL 756 and Macam SR9910 spectroradiometers. Figure [fig:Optronics:OL_756] shows the different parts of the first of these instruments.\n\n\n\n\nThe more rugged instruments, usually permanently installed at a fixed location, are commonly used for measuring long (several years long) time series of spectral irradiance data. The more portable instruments are used for spot measurements in plant canopies, and under lamps, and or filters. The first type of instrument is most commonly used by meteorologists, while the portable instruments are most useful to biologists.\n\n\n6.2.1.2 Characteristics\nDark current and dead time are characteristics possessed by the PMT. Dark current is a measure of the drift photons going from the cathode to the anode of the PMT without any real incident photons entering the instrument. Dead time is a measure of that PMT which is in a paralysed state after a photon detection event. Stray light is composed of photons reflected from wavelengths other than the nominal wavelength being measured. In commercially available scanning spectroradiometers, these phenomena are usually measured and handled by the measurement software.\nThe wavelength alignment of a spectroradiometer has to be checked regularly. Most instruments taking continuously sequential measurements contain an internal mercury lamp aimed at ensuring the stability of the alignment. The wavelength and the position of the micrometer turning the grating of the monochromator are related to each other by a second-order equation using so called dispersion coefficients. The determination of the dispersion coefficients should be part of the annual maintenance of the instruments.\nSolar irradiance spectra sometimes exhibit so called noise spikes, which mean sudden abnormally high or low intensity readings on a single wavelength. The origin of the spikes is not fully known, but straylight is considered a partial explanation. The spikes can be detected and eliminated making use of suitable reference spectra.\nIdeally, the angular response of the measurement head follows the shape of a cosine curve. In practice, the response deviates somewhat from this. Typically, the larger the solar zenith angle, the larger the deviation. The cosine response of the measurement head should be measured in laboratory and a corresponding correction applied to measured data.\nIf the spectroradiometer is not stabilized for temperature, its response usually exhibits temperature dependence. This dependence should be determined in the laboratory by measuring a calibration lamp with a spectroradiometer heated/cooled over a range of different wavelengths. The measurements can be used for deriving the temperature correction factors to be applied in the post-processing of the sky measurements.\nThe slit function determines the transmittance of a monochromator as a function wavelength. The ideal shape of the function would be triangular. The full width at half maximum of the slit function is commonly used as a quantity characterizing the slit function. The slit function can be derived by measuring the irradiance emitted by a tunable laser. Removal of the effect of the slit function on the measured spectra should be considered if spectra measured by two or several instruments are to be compared with each other.\nThe spectral responsivity of a spectroradiometer should be based on regular measurements of a certified calibration lamp. If the responsivity seems to have changed, basically two alternative ways to handle the change exist. The change may be introduced in the responsivity of the instrument and the processing of the sky measurements as such. A step-wise change in response is hence introduced in the time series of the measurements. Alternatively, a gradually changing response time-series may be defined using a moving average with a suitable time window. In this way, the change in the response is introduced gradually in the time series of the sky irradiance measurements.\n\n\n6.2.1.3 Maintenance\nThe maintenance of a scanning spectroradiometer operating in an outdoor environment involves the following practices: a) general daily maintenance; b) checks on the wavelength setting and stability of irradiance scale; c) calibration of irradiance against primary standards in a dark room.\nDaily routine maintenance includes cleaning of the quartz dome and checking on the general functioning as well as the correct levelling of the instrument. The quartz dome should also be cleaned/dried after rain or snow. The operator should be familiar with the control software of the instrument. Additional simple routines based on, for instance, selected reference spectra may be used for instant checking of the measured data. These kinds of routines are invaluable in the prompt detection of occasional malfunctions of the instrument.\nAn internal Hg lamp is used for checking of the wavelength scale in some spectroradiometers. In these cases, it is convenient to imbed the Hg lamp measurement into the daily measurement schedule. If the instrument lacks an internal lamp, this check has to be done using an external lamp. For checking the stability of the irradiance scale, portable calibration units are available. These enable, for instance, stability checks of the instrument at the measuring site on a weekly basis. It is advisable that the humidity indicators are also checked on a weekly basis.\nIrradiance calibration of a spectroradiometer should be performed in a dark room (Figure [fig:Brewer:calibration]). A primary standard lamp with an irradiance certificate provided by a certified laboratory of standards is needed. To extend the lifetime of the primary standard lamp, it is recommended that it is not used as a regular calibration lamp. Instead, the irradiance scale of the primary lamp should be transferred to a secondary standard lamp that is used as a working calibration lamp. Use of several working lamps is recommended to enable recognition of potential drifts in the radiant output of the lamps as they age. Calibration against the primary/secondary standard lamp should be performed at least every two months. The desiccant bags inside the cover of the spectrometer should be taken out and dried at least every two months as well. Proper levelling of the instrument has to be ensured after having it relocated for outdoor measurements.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nOn the annual maintenance practices of a spectroradiometer, each manufacturer has its own services and recommendations. Participation in intercomparison campaigns gathering a number of state-of-the-art instruments to conduct measurements on a jointly agreed schedule for a period of time has proven a fruitful way to investigate the long-term stabilities and overall performances of scanning spectroradiometers (Figure [fig:Brewer:intercomparison]).\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Array detector spectroradiometers\nIn contrast to scanning spectrometers, array detector instruments measure spectral irradiance simultaneously at all wavelengths. The detector in this case is a linear array of light sensors, similar in structure to the imaging sensors used in digital cameras, but long and narrow. The number of detector elements (‘pixels’) along the array varies, 2000 to 3000 pixels being common for visible light and fewer in IR-only spectrometers. The array can be a ‘charge coupled device’ (CCD), or an array of photodiodes (DAD). The ‘image’ of the spectrum produced by the monochromator is projected and focused by means of mirrors onto the linear detector array, each detector in the array receiving light of a certain very narrow range of wavelengths. In the case of array spectrometers it is not possible to use two monochromators in tandem to reduce stray light. Array spectrometers are small and portable (Figure [fig:Maya2000Pro]).\n \nFor measuring energy or photon spectral irradiance a cosine diffuser is used as input optics. This ensures that the angular response follows the cosine law, and so the instrument measures the radiation as received on a flat surface. Other input optics are also available, for example, with a narrow angle of view. However, the quantity measured with them is not irradiance. Cosine diffusers differ widely in how closely they follow the cosine law. Some cheaper models are prone to large errors, especially when radiation impinges at a sharp angle to their surface. This will be further discussed in section 9.7.2.1 on page .\nThe input optics is usually connected to the array spectrometer with an optical fibre. The type of fibre to be used depends on the wavelength range to be measured. If smaller than the entrance of the spectroradiometer, the diameter of the fibre will affect the amount of radiation entering the instrument. The diameter also affects the mechanical properties of the fibre: thin fibres are more flexible and tolerate bending into curves of smaller diameter. Fibres also vary with regards to the type of cladding material used to protect them. Fibres with metal cladding tolerate rougher handling than those with plastic cladding. The most common connector for these fibres and accessories is the SMA 905, originally designed for light fibres used in digital communication systems. For this reason their positioning upon repeated attachment is not exactly the same. Consequently, the recommendation is not to detach and reattach the fibre from the spectrometer without recalibrating the system[^24].\nAt the entrance of the spectrometer, just behind the connector to which the fibre is attached, there is a slit (Figure [fig:CCD:slit]), which limits the width and height of the incoming light beam. The width is of the order of a few micrometres and the exact value chosen determines, together with the monochromator, the spectral resolution of the spectroradiometer. The narrower the slit, the narrower the beam hitting the monochromator and the better the resolution (the narrower the peaks that can be resolved). In a Czerny-Turner configuration (Figure [fig:optical:bench]), the next component is a collimating mirror which projects the beam onto a monochromator. Gratings are used as monochromators. Gratings have a surface with very closely spaced rulings of a specific profile, and they separate radiation of different wavelengths in a similar way to a prism. One important parameter is the density of rulings which is one of the determinants of spectral resolution and useful wavelength range. The ‘image’ produced by the grating is focused onto the array detector by another collimating mirror. Some newer models of spectrometer from StellarNet (e.g. BLACK-Comet spectrometer) and now also from Ocean Optics (Torus spectrometer) use a concave grating instead of a planar one. Since the grating itself focuses the light onto the array detector, collimating mirrors are not needed. Having fewer optical components, an instrument with better stray light performance is obtained.\n\n \n\n\n \n\nThe array detector normally has rectangular ‘pixels’, orientated so that their shorter dimension is on the axis along which the different wavelengths have been separated by the monochromator, and their longer dimension is perpendicular to it. The entrance slit is positioned to have the long dimension coincident with the long dimension of the pixels. In some detectors the long pixels are in reality rows of square pixels with their electrical output combined into a single output signal. The output signal from the pixels is averaged by the detector itself over what is called ‘integration time’. The longer the integration used, the lower the irradiance that can be measured. However, the ‘dark noise’ increases with the integration time. In addition, it is possible to take several scans and average them. A coarse dark noise correction is sometimes done by subtracting the signal from special pixels at the end of the array that are not exposed to radiation. However a dark scan, with the input optics protected from the incoming radiation, should also be measured, and its value, wavelength by wavelength subtracted from the measurements. The dark noise depends on temperature. This has two implications, dark scans should be taken frequently, sometimes before or after each measurement, and the spectrometer should be allowed to warm up for some minutes before starting to take readings. Furthermore, when working outdoors it should be protected from direct sunlight, so as to keep its temperature stable and close to that at which it was calibrated. Some spectrometers have a thermoelement (TE), working according to the Peltier principle, which cools the array detector to a preset temperature and thereby stabilizes it.\nMost array spectrometers, the exception being some older models with thermoelectrically cooled detectors, are powered through the USB port. This can be the same USB link to a personal computer used to control them and retrieve the acquire spectral data. With the power delivery (PD) charging protocol now available, USB-C ports can provide much more power that the original USB 1.0 and 2.0 standards.\nFor field and mobile use a laptop is frequently used to control array spectrometers. Special software, sold by the manufacturer of the spectrometer, is frequently used to control the instrument and acquire and plot the spectra.\nFor most instruments there are also drivers and software development kits (SDK) available for developing programs for special applications. When special corrections, for example for stray light, are performed it may be necessary to acquire raw spectral data and apply corrections and calibrations off-line using other software, for example Excel or R. In some cases it is possible to control spectrometers and acquire data using a microcontroller board such as the Raspberry Pi.\nMany modern array spectrometers can communicate through Ethernet in addition to through USB. This makes it possible to control them through a local area network (LAN) or through a wide area network (WAN) such as the Internet.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nIn recent years handheld array spectroradiometers have become available that have a screen and small keyboard to control them. Nost of them are not designed to measure ultraviolet or infrared radiation but only vsisible. Several of these can be controlled wirelessly with a mobile phone through Bluetooth. Many of these are not intended for or accurate enough for use in scientific research. However, a few of them are. One example in the LI-180 from LI-COR. The proliferation of suppliers of low cost spectrometers, frequently providing incomplete descriptions and specifications, makes it hard to recommend any of them for serious use, even if some could be fine and be available in the future to provide support, repairs and updates.\n\n6.2.2.1 Measuring errors and limitations in accuracy\nArray spectroradiometers have a great advantage when quickly measuring changing radiation as they acquire all wavelengths simultaneously. This ensures that the values of spectral irradiance measured at all wavelengths are consistent. In contrast, under conditions where irradiance varies rapidly with time, the shape of the measured spectrum can get badly distorted when measured with a scanning spectroradiometer. However, array spectrometers have a serious limitation in that they cannot be built with double monochromators. As any spectroradiometer with a single monochromator, they suffer from relatively high values of stray light. Stray light originates from scattered light of incorrect wavelengths falling on a pixel of the array detector. In other words, radiation of one wavelength is detected (and measured) as radiation of a different wavelength. Perfectly scattered radiation would affect all pixels in the same way, but when there are reflections within the optical bench that are not perfectly scattered, some pixels in the array detector are more affected by stray light than others. Stray light is a critical specification when measuring UV-B in sunlight, as UV-B irradiance is very low compared to the irradiance of visible and near infra-red radiation. Consequently, if even a small proportion of visible radiation is scattered and reflected as stray light within the instrument, this stray light can generate a signal on the ‘UV-B pixels’ of the array of a magnitude similar to, or larger than, that produced by the radiation that we are trying to measure. Stray light is such a big problem that without very complicated and special corrections these instruments cannot be used at all to measure radiation in sunlight. Errors of more than 100%[^25] for biologically effective doses can be incurred even with a well calibrated instrument. Failure to take this into account has led to important mistakes, like the erroneous measurement of solar radiation at ground level by NASA researchers which was published in Geophysical Research Letters. This was most likely an artifact due to the limitations of the array spectrometer used. See the paper by D’Antoni et al. (2007) and the refutation by Stephan D. Flint et al. (2008) and the answer by D’Antoni, Rothschild, and Skiles (2008). Equally, the values of the UV-B doses used in many recent biological experiments, as reported in the publications, are suspect, since they have been based on measurements performed with single-monochromator instruments.\nGratings disperse radiation according to what are called ‘orders’. For example first order dispersion may be 10 nm/mm, second order dispersion 5 nm/mm, third order dispersion 2.5 nm/mm, and so on. The first order spectrum is what is of interest, and is what we want the array detector to see. However, any given ‘pixel’ in the array, in addition to radiation corresponding to the first order (e.g. 800 nm), also sees radiation corresponding to higher orders (e.g. 400 nm, 266.6 nm, 200 nm, and so on) if those wavelengths are present in the incoming radiation. The solution to this problem is to use ‘order-sorting filters’ in the light pass. In array spectrometers order-sorting filters may be directly coated onto the array detector, or attached to it. For example Ocean Optics spectrometers can be bought with a variable longpass order-sorting filter as an option (Figure [fig:CCD:slit]).\nAnother problem with array detector spectrometers is that the radiation may be better focused on some parts of the array than on others, and this causes changes in spectral resolution with changing wavelengths. In addition, the wavelength difference between adjacent pixels is not always the same across the whole spectrum, neither is the step size an integer number. Usually the software supplied with the instrument can generate files with data at integer steps (e.g. 1 nm, or 5 nm) but this is done by interpolating and averaging, rather than changing the measurement itself. In contrast the scanning step of scanning spectroradiometers can be controlled through its software.\nThe overall accuracy of the measurements is also reliant on the angular response of the entrance optics. For measuring spectral irradiance we generally use a cosine diffusor as entrance optics, although it is also possible to use an integrating sphere. Deviations of cosine diffusers from the theoretical angular response tend to increase at large angles from the vertical. If the spectrum of the light coming from different angles is different (e.g. sun and sky) not only the irradiance measured may be inaccurate but also the shape of the spectrum may be distorted. When measuring outdoors, the size of this error will change through a day as the sun moves across the sky. The very small cosine diffusers sold by the spectrometer manufacturers tend to be prone to large errors, and individually calibrated, high quality diffusers like the D7-SMA and D7-H-SMA from Bentham (see section 9.20 on page for full address) are preferable, although they are much more expensive (Figure [fig:Bentham:diffuser]).\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2.2 Calibration and corrections\nWhen measuring UV-B with an array spectroradiometer it is not enough to have it properly calibrated, its optical characteristics (slit function at different wavelengths, stray light properties) need to be measured and a correction algorithm developed and later applied to each measurement. This makes the use of array spectroradiometers for characterizing UV-B doses complicated and error prone. This type of use has to be attempted only by experienced operators and the correction algorithm itself requires lots of effort to develop and implement. Given the lack of standardized procedures for stray light correction, its implementation requires advanced knowledge of optics and metrology. We will first discuss spectral calibration and thereafter stray light correction procedures.\nSpectral calibration against standard lamps needs to be repeated regularly. For measurements not requiring very high precision, annual re-calibrations may be enough. However, the main consideration should be how valuable is the data that will be acquired. If the spectral sensitivity of the instrument has changed significantly from one calibration to the next, the data from all measurements done in between these calibrations are suspect, and should be discarded. Consequently if one does yearly re-calibrations one can lose one year’s worth of data, while if one does monthly re-calibrations one only risks losing one month’s worth of data. Consequently, the decision on how frequently to calibrate should, in addition to instrument stability, be based on the maximum size of the tolerable errors and on the value of the data (i.e. the cost of replacing the data if they need to be discarded).\nThe most common and stable calibration light sources are incandescent lamps (e.g. FEL lamps) with electronics in the power source which keeps the electrical power at the filament constant within very narrow margins. The distance between the lamp and the entrance optics, and their alignment, should also fall within a very narrow margin of the expected values. Calibration lamps are secondary or tertiary standards, connected by a chain of calibration steps to a standard kept at a metrology agency like NIST. Calibration lamps are supplied with spectral data about their emission characteristics. Calibration of the instrument is done by measuring the known spectrum and irradiance of the calibration lamp. Of course the output of the lamp will not exactly match the data supplied with it, because its original calibration is also subject to errors. Furthermore, there are errors deriving from slight differences between the burning conditions (current and voltage) during measurements and those when it was calibrated at the factory. Further errors can be introduced by small differences in the geometry of the optical setup. So, do not forget that calibrations are subject to errors. Furthermore, you cannot obtain an absolute estimate of calibration errors by comparing two instruments calibrated with the same lamp, unless this lamp is the primary standard.\nCalibrating a spectroradiometer in the UV-B band with a FEL lamp is not recommended, because FEL lamps emit very little UV-B. For calibration in the UV-B deuterium lamps need to be used. Irradiance emitted by deuterium lamps is less stable than that emitted by FEL lamps. For coarse calibration the use of a deuterium lamp may be enough, but for accurate calibration it is best to use FEL and deuterium lamps in tandem. The shape of the spectrum emitted by deuterium lamps is stable, by matching the irradiances at wavelengths where the emission of both types of lamps overlap, one can extend an accurate calibration to shorter wavelengths. Spectrometer manufacturers also sell calibration light sources (lamp plus electronics) that may be good for routine calibration or especially for checking that calibrations performed in an optical bench remain valid. Again, what type of calibration procedure and lamp to use will depend on the accuracy required. If we want our measurements to be within \\pm 10% of the true value we will need to use very good equipment and protocols for the calibration. If we can tolerate errors of, for example, \\pm 25%, calibrations can be less accurate.\nIt is also very important to do a wavelength calibration and to check this calibration regularly. It should not be forgotten when doing this calibration that it is affected by the temperature of the instrument as temperature affects (by thermal expansion) the dimensions of the optical bench and its components. Wavelength calibration is done based on elemental emission lines in discharge lamps (or even the sun). For quick checks low pressure mercury or germicidal lamps may be used. The manufacturers of spectrometers also sell special light sources for wavelength calibration. One should choose carefully which wavelengths to use (for example 253.652 nm, 296.728 nm, 334.148 nm, and 404.657 nm for mercury lamps, as they are simple peaks rather than multiple peaks very close together like those at 302 nm, 313 nm and 365 nm). If one desires a calibration accurate to a fraction of the wavelength step of the array one needs to fit a bell-shaped curve to the pixel showing the highest signal and those adjacent to it, to find the true location of the peak centre, most likely in-between two pixels.\nTo keep errors within \\pm 10% in the UV-B when measuring sunlight, and especially to keep errors within \\pm 10% for biologically effective doses, a good calibration is not enough when using single monochromator spectroradiometers. There is also a need to correct for stray light. If we do not correct for stray light some biologically effective doses will be overestimated by more than 100%. The ratio between stray light in the UV-B band and the maximum spectral irradiance measured in good single monochromator spectrometers is approximately 1\\times 10^{-3}, while in double monochromator spectroradiometers it can be as low as 1 \\times 10^{-6}. If time for scanning, cost and lack of portability are no obstacles, it’s preferable to use double monochromator instruments and these should also be used as the main instrument in a laboratory.\nWhen applying the stray light correction, a thorough characterization of the slit function at different wavelengths and a check of the wavelength dependence of stray light are needed. This characterization does not need to be repeated, unless changes are made to the optical bench of the instrument. So, in contrast to the spectral calibration, the stray light characterization needs to be performed only once during the lifetime of the instrument unless major repairs or modifications are made.\nIn some array spectrometers, depending on the configuration, the width of the slit function may vary with the wavelength. This can introduce errors that are very difficult to correct. In some cases it might be preferable to chose a grating giving the instrument a relatively narrow wavelength range, for example 250 nm to 500 nm if the intended use is to measure ultraviolet radiation.\nThe use and calibration of array spectroradiometers for measurement of UV-B radiation in sunlight is discussed in detail in the WMO report by Seckmeyer, Bais, Bernhard, Blumthaler, Drüke, et al. (2010). Stray light correction methods are discussed in the papers by Ylianttila et al. (2005), Coleman, Sarkany, and Walker (2008), and Kreuter and Blumthaler (2009) and the references therein.",

    "section": "6.3 Broadband sensors",
    "text": "6.3 Broadband sensors\nBroadband sensors in most cases measure irradiance in a single broad range of wavelengths or band. Most broadband sensors used in plant research are based on a photodiode, a filter to constrain the range of wavelengths reaching the photodiode and a diffuser that provides an angular response close to that proportional to the cosine of the angle of incidence of light over \\pm90^\\circ from the normal, in three dimensions.\nNot all broadband sensors measure irradiance: sensors with a different angular response that proportional to the cosine of the angle are also available. Of these, most common are those with a narrow aperture angle such as \\pm5^\\circ from the normal. Spherical diffusers are used in aquatic sciences to measure fluence rate and spherical irradiance. Least common are hemispherical diffusers used to measure hemispherical irradiance or the fluence rate on a plane.\nIn traditional multichannel broadband sensors, such as red and far-red sensors, each channel consists in a discrete photodiode and filter, with the channels sharing the same cosine diffuser.\nNot all broadband sensors rely on Silicon photodiodes. Some broadband sensors are based of photodiodes made of other semiconductor materials such as Silicon Carbide, Germanium, and Indium Gallium Arsenide. In addition, some ultraviolet sensors rely on the secondary emission from an intermediate compound to convert ultraviolet radiation into visible radiation that can be more easily detected with Silicon photodiodes. These will be discussed later as the detector choice depends on the wavelength band measured.\nAlthough many broadband sensors simply provide the raw electric current from the photodiodes as output, others have built-in amplification with a voltage output, More recent designs include analogue to digital conversion circuitry and provide as output through a digital interface. Nowadays, some suppliers even sell multiple versions of each of their sensors, differing only in the interface used to retrieve the readings. As these interfaces are unrelated to the measured quantities, they are described here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpectral response of broadband sensors\n\n\n\nThe spectral response of broadband sensors almost always differs to a larger or smaller extent from that in the definition of the quantity being measured. The consequence of this is that the calibration of any broadband sensors is not constant, it varies depending on the spectrum of the radiation being measured. In some cases these differences are so small that can be ignored, but in other cases ignoring they can introduce large biases, invalidating the measurements. In general the broader and more featureless radiation spectrum is, the less likely a large bias is. In addition, some patterns of spectral response are technically easier to create than others.\nA very frequent and grave mistake is to assume a priori that a calibration provided by the sensor supplier, e.g., for sunlight is applicable to artificial light sources, such as discharge lamps, incandescent lamps or LEDs. Some suppliers provide approximate correction factors (e.g., Apogee for sensor SQ-301X-SS) or clear warnings in the documentation, while others do not even warn users. In the case of sensors good enough to be used in research, suppliers do provide typical spectral response curves. Such curves are not guaranteed, and should be taken with a grain of salt but can be used to estimate the possible calibration errors. This does not replace a light-source specific calibration.\n\n\n\n6.3.1 Photodiode current\nThe electrical current generated by a photodiode is almost proportional to the absorbed photons of a given wavelength, until its response saturates. The dark current is extremely low. Thus, the best Si photodiodes show a linear response over several orders of magnitude of irradiance. As the current depends on the captured photons, the larger the area of the photodiode the higher the current generated. The principle of operation is similar to that of solar panels used for power generation. The diodes used in sensors have relatively small area and the generated current is small, in the order of a few mA. Thus long wiring can distort the signal or pick electrical noise from other devices. A sensitive and accurate measuring device is necessary to measure medium and low irradiances. Each sensor and sensor channel needs to be wired individually to a current measuring device with a high enough impedance not to affect to the functioning of the sensor. These sensors do not require a power supply and only two wires needed between the sensor and meter or datalogger. The time constant of the these sensors is very short, in some cases less that a ms and dependent on the capacitance of the wiring.\n\n\n6.3.2 Amplified voltage\nSome sensors have a built-in amplifier that converts the small current generated by the photodiode into a voltage, commonly in 0\\ldots 5 V or 0\\ldots 10 V. Unless the amplifier is very well designed, it can introduce a small zero offset and introduce temeprature dependence. These sensors do require power for the amplifier to operate. The wiring is less sensitive to electrical noise and a measuring device of lower sensitivity and impedance can be used without affecting the accuracy of the measurement. The time constant of the response of these sensors vary as it is mainly dependent on the design of the built-in amplifiers. It can vary from a few ms to 1 s or longer.\n\n\n6.3.3 Amplified current\nRarely used in research but frequently used in indutrial automation are amplified sensor with a current output in the range 4\\ldots 20 mA. In this protocol 4 mA corresponds to a zero reading. This relative high current makes this type of wiring rather inmune to electrical noise. The drawback is that these sensors consume more power than those using alternative approaches, making them unsuitable for battery or solar-panel powered systems.\n\n\n6.3.4 Digitital communication\nDigital communication protocols can provide two big advantages: the sharing of wiring among separate sensors or between channels in a single sensor. As data are transmitted as encoded numbers, their integrity can be checked. The most frequently used wired protocol is SDI12 (serial data interface at 1200 bit s-1). These sensors have built in circuitry for converting the current from the sensor or the amplified voltage into a digital value. Many are also able to computed time averages from individual measurements and keep the most recent value in local memory. The “measuring” device, computer or logger, queries the sensor for specific data and the sensor replies by sending a number encoded as train of binary 0 and 1 plus a code to check integrity. Each sensor has an address that identifies it within the sharing wiring and the logger or other measuring device addresses its queries to a single sensor at a time. Multiple commands can be implemented in a single sensor, even commands that change its behaviour. It allows long wiring in addition to sharing it. Its drawback is that the data rate is low, so data can be retrieved from sensors at most once every few seconds. This time increases the more sensors share the wiring as they need to be queried sequentially. Sensors implementing the SDI12 tend to be more expensive than those based on simpler approaches. On the other hand they remove the need to use loggers capable of accurate and high resolution analogue to digital conversion.\nIn addtion to SDI12 other digital electrical and communication protocols are in use for sensors. Two well-known serial protocols are RS-232 and RS-485. The first of them is point to point with no sharing of wiring and it was common in personal computers in the 1980’s and 1990’s. RS-232 even is data are sent serial through a single pair of wires, acknowledgement and synchronization takes places through additional wires. In RS-485, from around the same time, wiring can be shared and addressing and coordination requires fewer wires. These are electrical protocols. MODBUS is a comand protocol that uses RS485 and is still in use, mainly in industrial automation but occasionaly also for tasks like greenhouse automation and sensors.\n\n\n6.3.5 Miniature integrated sensors\nA newer type of sensors, originally developed for use in mobile phones and TV sets, are integrated circuits that have multiple photodiodes and the ancillary amplification and analogue to digital conversion electronics built-in. They come in SMD pacakages with footprints as small as 2\\times 3 mm. In some cases the photodiodes have interference filters deposited directly onto the silicon chip surface creating channels responsive to different wavelength bands. These sensors are extremely small with all channels tightly clustered within an area of the order of one to a few square millimetres. Some of these sensors can do simple digital data processing to convert the measurements into physical or photobiological quantities of interest. These sensors are designed to be paired to microcontrollers and communicate with them using short-range digital serial communication protocols and installed in devices. Ready to use devices, specially weather-proof ones, are not yet commercially available. Some very cheap handheld spectrometers are probably already based on these sensors, although the suppliers do not disclose their design. Small modules including a logger have been developed based on these integrated circuits. Also instructions, breakout boards, code libraries are available for different popular micro-controller-based boards like different flavours of Arduino, Rasperry Pi and ESP32. Compared to traditional sensors these modules are much cheaper and less accurate but still very versatile. For example the 14-channels AS7343 spectral sensor from ams OSRAM sells for 7 € individually and much cheaper in quantity. The USB module Yoto-Spectral from Yocto-Puce with built-logger based on this same spectral sensor sells for 60 €. These sensors are less accurate than traditional ones but the cost advantage is overwhelming allowing high replication while the built in logger makes deployment easy.\n\n\n6.3.6 Wireless communication\nThere are multiple approaches to wireless transmission of sensor data. Some rely on protocols widely used in other domains, such as Wifi, Bluetooth or even GSM. In recent years the popularization of the internet of things (IoT) has encouraged the development of protocols optimised for transmission of sparse data from sensors, including LoRa and low throughput/low energy variants of Wifi and GSM.\nSelecting the wireless protocol to use depends mainly on necessary range, data transmission throughput and the availability of power sources. The architecture, meaning which data links are wired and which ones wireless can also vary. One approach is to have individual sensors communicating wirelessly to a base station where data are collected and possibly forwarded to remote storage (e.g., Aranet’s). Alternatively, multiple sensors can be wired to a hub and the hub connected wirelessly to a router by Wifi, wired through ethernet or through GSM or some other protocol.",

    "section": "6.4 Data retrieval and logging",
    "text": "6.4 Data retrieval and logging\nOn-site data loggers with wired sensors is a common and relaible approach, both at accessible and remote sites. Data are stored locally but in most cases can be accessed locally, remotely or both. Data are normally downloaded from the logger in batches. Modern loggers with ample memory can safely store large data sets. Most loggers have an assortment of inputs, both analogue and digital making it possible to attach sensors based on a mix of different analogue and digital communication protocols. The best data loggers have analogue to digital converters (ADC) with a resolution of 24 bits and auto ranging. Some dataloggers like Campbell Scientific CR6 can take up to 100 readings per second simultaneously on more than one analogue input. They can be programmed to take measurements only under certain conditions, compute and store summaries like means and histograms instead of raw data, to power on and off instruments and control ancillary equipment like cameras. Data loggers for use in the field have been around for over 50 years and are a stable and reliable, but expensive.\nSmall loggers, with only one or two channels and built-in sensors have been available for some decades. Illumination loggers and PAR loggers are available. Most of these sensors do not provide as good a performance as separate sensors and loggers but are overall cheaper and easier to deploy, although on site data collection from multiple loggers can become time consuming. The iButton Thermocron temperature loggers in a button-cell-like case are widely used, rugged and small. Nothing like them is available for measuring light. PAR loggers are larger in size.\nSome sensors with logging capabilities are also capable of being remotely accessed. They provide the best of both worlds as data are locally stored independently of any break in communication, but can be accessed remotely to download the data, change settings or even update the firmware.",

    "section": "6.5 Summaries based on wavelength ranges",
    "text": "6.5 Summaries based on wavelength ranges\nThe rest of this section is organized with one section for each group of related measured quantities. In each of these sections the different instruments and sensors and well as computations used to compute them from spectral irradiance are presented.\n\n6.5.1 Global radiation and pyranometers\nThe term global radiation describes most of the radiation at ground level that arrives from the sun, what in meteorology is called shortwave radiation, extending from approximately 280 nm in the UV to nearly 2800–3000 nm in the IR. Pyranometers measure radiation in this range as energy irradiance (\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}).\nPyranometers are the most common radiation sensor used in meteorology, and long-term time series of global radiation data from weather stations are available. The best performing pyranometers use as sensor a blackened thermopile (multiple thermocouples in series) enclosed to isolate it from the air and external temperature changes. The thermopile behaves like a black body and warms up in response to the incident energy flux. A difference in temperature between the two sides of the thermopile generates a voltage difference approximately proportional to the energy flux. The design ensures that radiation of nearly all wavelengths in the global radiation range are nearly fully and equally absorbed. Consequently, for radiation within the range 290 nm to nearly 2800 nm a single calibration is usually valid Figure 6.1.\nIn contrast to most other radiation sensors, the spectral response of thermopile pyranometers is in close agreement with the theoretical quantity they are intended to measure. The performance of thermopile pyranometers is described using standardised “classes”, with each class having different requirements for performance and accuracy. The current ISO 9060:2018 standard, calls the classes: A, B, and C, with required minimum performance decreasing from A to C (formerly named “secondary standard”, “first class” and “second class”). Thermopiles in pyranometers are protected by one or two concentric quartz domes. Some thermopiles used to measure radiation in laboratories have more rudimentary or no protection. The best know supplier of pyranometers is Kipp. The original design of the thermopile and domes has remained nearly unchanged for decades. Versions with amplified and calibrated voltage output, amplified current output as well as digital output have been released more recently and coexist with earlier ones.\nCheaper “silicon” pyranometers work on a very different principle: a semiconductor photodiode generates a current of electrons proportional to absorbed photons. The response varies with wavelength not only because of the varying energy per photon, but also because their quantum efficiency varies with wavelength. The spectral response of these pyranometers is not flat with respect energy or photon irradinace Figure 6.1. In other words, there is a mismatch between the spectral response of the sensor and the spectral weighting of the physical quantity measured. The consequence of this is that sensor calibration is not independent of the spectrum of the radiation being measured! This is also the case with most other broadband sensors based on silicon-, silicon carbide-, and photodiodes made from other semiconductor materials.\n\n\nCode\nglobal.wb &lt;- waveband(c(280, 2800), \n                      SWF.e.fun = function(x) {1}, \n                      norm = 550, \n                      SWF.norm = 550,\n                      wb.name = \"global radiation\")\nautoplot(global.wb, range = c(100, 3500), geom = \"spct\") /\n  (autoplot(sensors.mspct[c(\"Skye_SKS1110\", \"LICOR_LI_200\", \"KIPP_CM21\")],\n            idfactor = \"Pyranometer:\",\n            range = c(100, 3500),\n            annotations =c(\"-\", \"peaks\"), \n            w.band = global.wb) +\n     theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n  ) +\n  plot_layout(axes = \"collect\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Comparison of the definition of global radiation to the spectral response of three pyranometers. The Kipp CM21 pyranometer is a thermopile-based instrument with an spectral response approximating the theoretical response. The Skye SKS1110 and LI-COR LI-200 are based on silicon photodiodes and even if their spectral response differs drastically from the expected one, they are calibrated to give a reading approximating global radiation only when used in sunlight.\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal radiation cannot normally be computed from measured spectral irradiance, as spectrometers in common use do not have a wide enough wavelength sensitivity range.\n\n\n6.5.2 Photosynthetic radiation and quantum sensors\nGiven the central role of photosynthesis, multiple radiation quantities to quantify radiation that can drive the light reactions of photosynthesis have been proposed over the years. A few competing quantities remain currently in use. McCree’s definition of the photon irradiance of photosynthetically active radiation (Q_\\mathrm{PAR}) is overwhelmingly preferred nowadays. Q_\\mathrm{PAR} is frequently described as photosynthetic photon flux density and abbreviated PPFD. PPFD is not used outside the plant sciences, “photon flux density” widely accepted name is “photon irradiance” and its symbol is Q. However, several other quantities can be found in the current and specially past scientific literature on plant biology, plant ecology and meteorology. Some of them, locationally, even under the same name “photosynthetically active radiation” or PAR as McCree’s.\nEarly on, given the availability of illuminance sensors, values expressed in lux and foot candles were frequently used. In meteorology pyranometers, and in Physics thermopiles, described above, have been in use for a long time, and were also used to report energy irradiances. Both of these approaches are inadequate and have been mostly abandoned in studies related to photosynthesis and plant biology.\nThe earliest and simplest approach that considered the response to light of photosynthesis was to constrain the range of wavelengths over which spectral energy irradiance was integrated to those contributing to photosynthesis, however, with no agreement on the best range of wavelengths to use.\nSpectral photon irradiance can also be integrated over a wavelength range. As described in chapter XXXX, the use of photon or energy as base of expression to quantify radiation are not equivalent, and interconversion is only possible if the light spectrum shape is known. As for any photochemically driven reaction, absorption of photons excites chlorophyll molecules and this excitation energy drives the chemical reactions. Thus, from a mechanistic perspective photon irradiance should be preferred. Still in the early 1970’s there was no consensus and multiple ways of describing the radiation in studies with plants, including photosynthesis, where in use. To make things worse, interconversion was in most cases impossible as spectral information was not available (McCree1972a?), McCree (1972), (McCree1976?). McCree’s proposal of PAR aimed to address this problem, and was based on a large set of measurements of the spectral response of photosynthesis.\nIn other words, PAR, as defined by McCree (1972) is the integral over wavelengths of the spectral photon irradiance\nQ_\\mathrm{PAR} = \\int_\\mathrm{400\\,nm}^\\mathrm{700\\,nm} Q(\\lambda)\\ d \\lambda\nand is not directly equivalent to the integral of the spectral energy irradiance over the same range of wavelengths,\nE_\\mathrm{PAR} \\neq E_\\mathrm{PhR} = \\int_\\mathrm{400\\,nm}^\\mathrm{700\\,nm} E(\\lambda)\\ d \\lambda\nwhere we E_\\mathrm{PhR} is photosynthetic energy irradiance as defined by (Gabrielsen1940?) and no longer in use in plant and agriculture research but still used in meteorology, also under the name of PAR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPAR as defined by McCree (1972) is based on a very simple biological spectral weighting function (BSWF) according to which all photons in \\lambda\\ \\mathrm{in} 400\\ldots700\\,\\mathrm{nm} drive photosynthesis with equal efficiency Figure 6.2.\n\n\nCode\nautoplot(PAR(), unit.in = \"photon\", unit.out = \"photon\") | \n  autoplot(PAR(), unit.in = \"photon\", unit.out = \"energy\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: The biological spectral weighting function (BSWF) of PAR as defined by McCree, plotted as normalised response per energy quantum (or photon) and per energy of incident light.\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, the PAR BSWF used with photon irradiance, is implicit in the equation above, which could be written also as\nQ_\\mathrm{PAR} = \\int_\\mathrm{400\\,nm}^\\mathrm{700\\,nm} a_q(\\lambda)\\times Q(\\lambda)\\ d \\lambda\nwhere\na_q(\\lambda) = 1\\ \\forall\\ 400 \\leq \\lambda \\leq 700\nThat the action per photon is invariant with wavelengths implies that the effectiveness of energy depends inversely on wavelength based on Plank’s law. This makes it possible to re-express the PAR BSWF in energy units. However, the conversion is not unique, as it needs to be normalised based on a reference wavelength. Below, 550 nm, the wavelength at the centre of the 400\\ldots 700 nm wavelength range, was chosen rather arbitrarily.\nE_\\mathrm{PAR} = \\int_\\mathrm{400\\,nm}^\\mathrm{700\\,nm} a_e(\\lambda)\\times E(\\lambda)\\ d \\lambda\nwhere a_e(\\lambda) = \\lambda / 550 when using \\lambda = 550 nm as normalization wavelength for the BSWF.\nThe purpose of this explanation is to demonstrate that PAR is intrinsically defined as a photon irradiance, not as a wavelength range as sometimes erroneously assumed. PAR should always be reported as a photon irradiance (Q_\\mathrm{PAR} = PPFD) and a different name used for the energy irradiance E_\\mathrm{PhR}, if used at all.\nFor sunlight, when using \\lambda = 550\\,\\mathrm{nm} for normalization, the difference between E_\\mathrm{PhR} and E_\\mathrm{PAR} is quantitatively rather small, but for some other light sources the difference is too large to be ignored.\n\n\nThe definition of PAR proposed by McCree (1972) was inspired by how illuminance, the brightness of light as perceived by humans is routinely measured. He proposed a definition based on numerous action spectra of photosynthesis he had measured in leaves of several different crop plants. These action spectra were based on absorbed photons rather than on the incident photon flux. He decided to ignore the effect of variation in absorptance on the basis that absorptance is very high in leaves of healthy plants. Thus, when we use PAR to quantify light we assume all incident photons in the range 400\\ldots 700 nm absorbed and equally effective.\nPAR does not attempt to describe the light response of photosynthesis of plants of any given species growing in any specific environment. PAR is a technical method for quantification of light in a way relevant to plants in general, approximating the response expected from important crop plants just enough for it to be useful. In this respect, it is similar to how the brightness of illumination is assessed based on the typical response of human vision, ignoring variation among individuals.\nPAR sensors are in most cases based on silicon photodiodes filtered to change the spectral response to better approximate that of the PAR BSWF. There is considerable variation in how close this match is, although in no case the deviation is as extreme as with photodiode-based pyranometers Figure 6.3. Thus, calibrations are dependent on the light spectrum to variable extents, and these deviations should be taken into account when not using the sensors under the light source they are calibrated to. In most cases, manufacturers calibrate PAR sensors for sunlight.\n\n\nCode\nautoplot(PAR(), range = c(300, 800), geom = \"spct\",\n            unit.in = \"photon\", unit.out = \"photon\") /\n  (autoplot(sensors.mspct[c(\"LICOR_LI_190R\", \"apogee_sq_500\", \"apogee_sq_100X\")],\n            idfactor = \"PAR sensor:\",\n            w.band = PAR(),\n            range = c(300, 800),\n            annotations =c(\"-\", \"peaks\"), \n            unit.out = \"photon\") +\n     theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n  ) +\n  plot_layout(axes = \"collect\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Comparison of McCree’s defintion of photosinthetically active radiation (PAR) to the spectral response of three PAR (=quantum) sensors. The three sensors are based on silicon photodiodes, with different filters. The Apogee SQ-100X is a low cost sensor while the other two are more expensive and using special optical filters. They are sold calibrated to give a reading approximating PAR when used in sunlight. The errors incurred when using such calibrations to measure light from other sources depends both on the sensor and on the light source.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome years after McCree proposed the use of PAR, another quantity was proposed using the actual average of the action spectra measured by McCree as BSWF. It was originally named Yield Photon Flux (originally YPF, here PQYR for photosynthetic-quantum-yield weighted radiation). As McCree published two different mean action spectra, one for field-grown crop plants and one for growth-chamber-grown crop plants we end up with two new variations on photosynthetically active radiation. This approach also extends the wavelength range to that in the measured action spectra. No broadband sensors are available for measuring PQYR and needs to be measured with a spectroradiometer or a PAR sensor with a light-source specific calibration. (xxxx?) Bugbee et al tested the difference….\n\n\nCode\nautoplot(PAR(\"McCree.field.mean\"), \n         unit.in = \"photon\", unit.out = \"photon\") | \n  autoplot(PAR(\"McCree.chamber.mean\"), \n           unit.in = \"photon\", unit.out = \"photon\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: The mean action spectra reported by McCree for leaves from field- and controlled-environment-grown crop plants and later used in the definition of YFD (PQYR eher). Normalised response as \\mathrm{CO_2} fixed per absorbed photon is plotted on the central wavelegth of 25 nm wide bands of illuminations used. The curves are interpolating natural spline.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt must be kept in mind that the original spectra were measured under single colour light in bands 25 nm wide spaced by 25 to 30 nm. Differently to with McCree’s definition, when calculating these quantities the weights (a_q(\\lambda)) applied are extracted directly from the mean action spectrum curve, as for PAR, ignoring the difference between incident and absorbed photons. The weights are different for energy and photon spectral irradiance, corresponding to action spectra being expressed per unit energy or per photon (or mole of photons).\nQ_\\mathrm{PQYR} = \\int_{\\mathrm{350\\,nm}}^\\mathrm{750\\,nm} a_q(\\lambda)\\times\nQ(\\lambda)\\ d \\lambda\nA more recent variation on PAR is extended PAR (ePAR) (ZhenXXX?) and justified in that far-red photons can drive photosynthesis. Extended PAR is based on the same simple photon-based BSWF as McCree’s PAR but with the wavelength range extended by 50 nm into the far red region, thus, based on a wavelength range of 400\\ldots 750 nm.\nQ_\\mathrm{ePAR} = \\int_\\mathrm{400\\,nm}^\\mathrm{750\\,nm} Q(\\lambda)\\ d \\lambda\nHowever, the role of far red light in photosynthesis is synergistic, known as Emerson’s effect. Far red light cannot drive photosynthesis on its own, but only when shorter wavelengths are concurrently present with high enough photon irradiance. Simple ePAR sensors like the SQ-610-SS from Apogee Figure 6.5 ignore this, and do give an ePAR reading higher than zero under pure far-red radiation from LEDs and possibly too high readings under light from incandescent lamps. When computing extended PAR from spectral data, the VIS light requirement can be considered in the calculations and the value capped when needed to account for the synergistic nature of the response to far red. We use xPAR to describe the constrained version of ePAR. The factor 1.4 used in the equation below is a coarse approximation.\nQ_\\mathrm{xPAR} = \\mathrm{min}\\left(1.4 \\times \\int_\\mathrm{400\\,nm}^\\mathrm{700\\,nm} Q(\\lambda)\\ d \\lambda,\\ \\ \\\n\\int_\\mathrm{400\\,nm}^\\mathrm{750\\,nm} Q(\\lambda)\\ d \\lambda\\right)\nApogee sells a two channel sensor, PAR + FR, (S2-141-SS) that makes this check possible.\n\n\nCode\nautoplot(PAR(\"ePAR\"), range = c(300, 800), geom = \"spct\",\n         unit.in = \"photon\", unit.out = \"photon\") /\n  (autoplot(sensors.mspct[c(\"apogee_sq_610\")],\n            idfactor = \"Pyranometer:\",\n            range = c(300, 800),\n            annotations =c(\"-\", \"peaks\", \"summaries\"), \n            w.band = list(ePAR = PAR(\"ePAR\")),\n            unit.out = \"photon\") +\n     theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n  ) +\n  plot_layout(axes = \"collect\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: Comparison of the definition of the ePAR to the spectral response of one single-channel ePAR sensor and a two-channel PAR + FR sensor. The two Apogee sensors are based on filterd silicon photodiodes, they are callibrated to give a reading approximating ePAR, PAR and FR in 700 to 750 nm when used in sunlight.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the proposal of PAR by McCree two quantities based on similar wavelength ranges were proposed as relevant to photosynthesis, but based on integrating spectral energy irradiance. The (Gabrielsen1940?) used the same wavelength range as McCree’s PAR (400\\ldots 700 nm) while that proposed by Nichiporovich used a slightly wider band of wavelengths one (380\\ldots 710 nm).\nWith a spectroradiometer we can measure the spectral energy irradiance, and if necessary convert it into spectral photon irradiance, and apply any of the equations above to obtain measured values for the different quantities described above. Table 6.1 shows the results of applying this approach to several different natural and artificial light sources. Most important is that the differences among them depend on the spectrum of the light source.\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.1: Various photon irradiances (Q_i) used to quantify light useful for photosynthesis.

No PAR sensor matches exactly the spectral response in the definition of PAR or the cosine response. The best sensors provide a good approximation and simpler (usually cheaper) sensors deviate more from PAR’s definition and at low angles of incidence.\nIn any light with a broad spectrum and no high peaks or deep valleys a good PAR sensor will measure reasonably well PAR even if calibrated for sunlight. In contrast, a simple PAR sensor calibrated in sunlight can be off by as much as 30% if used to measure light from an incandescent lamp. If used to measure a light source with a narrow emission spectrum, such as a low pressure sodium lamp or single colour LED, the error can be even larger. Such problems can be resolved by use of light-source specific calibrations. Taken to the extreme, if the light spectrum does not change, any sensor, even a bare photodiode that responds to some of this light can be calibrated and used to measure PAR. Even with the best PAR sensors, measurements of light from single-colour LEDs emitting at some wavelengths, specially those near the boundaries near 400 and 700 nm, can be biased. When measuring single-colour LEDs using a broadband sensor it is recommended to validate the sensor calibration against a parallel measurement against a spectroradiometer. As photodiodes have an almost perfectly linear response to irradiance, in most cases a single point calibration is enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident vs. absorbed photons\n\n\n\nPAR photon irradiance quantifies the incident flux of photons and is usually measured on a horizontal plane. When studying the mechanism of photosynthesis, in many cases it must be remembered that PAR irradiance can be very far from being a measure of the flux of absorbed photons per unit leaf area. Leaves differing in chlorophyll concentration per unit area, thickness, mesophyll cell size and shapes, hairiness, cuticular waxes, and any other feature that modifies their optical properties, can absorb different proportions of the PAR photons incident on their surfaces. These differences as well as differences in irradiance at the leaf plane due to differences in leaf display angle or in light interception as a result of canopy structure must be taken into consideration when interpreting responses to PAR. In fact, leaf absorptance is dynamic as it depends on the accumulation movements of chloroplasts that have time constants in the order of minutes.",

    "text": "6.6 Photon and energy ratios\nOne way of coarsely describing the shape of spectra is to express irradiance in one region of the spectrum relative to that in a different region. In photobiology photon ratios are the main interest, while in some applications energy ratios or photon to energy ratios are relevant.\nWe can, for example, compute the red to far-red (R:FR) photon ratio, relevant to responses mediated by the photoreceptor phytochromw, as the ratio between two photon irradiances.\nQ_\\mathrm{red}:Q_\\mathrm{far\\ red} = \\frac{\\int_{\\lambda = 650\\,\\mathrm{nm}}^{\\lambda = 670\\,\\mathrm{nm}} Q(\\lambda) \\,d\\lambda}{\\int_{\\lambda = 725\\,\\mathrm{nm}}^{\\lambda = 745\\,\\mathrm{nm}} Q(\\lambda) \\,d\\lambda}\nwhere \\lambda is wavelength, Q photon (= quantum) is irradiance and Q(\\lambda) spectral photon irradiance. In this example using the most frequently used 20-nm-wide wavelength bands centred at \\lambda = 660\\,\\mathrm{nm} for red light and at \\lambda = 735\\,\\mathrm{nm} for far red light (). (It is possible to use in place of irradiances, time integrated quantities such as fluence, as long as the time and spatial bases of expression used for the numerator and denominator are the same).\nTwo main kinds of photon ratios are in use in plant photobiology. Ratios like the red to far-red (R:FR) photon ratio computed above in which the photon irradiances in the numerator and denominator are for non-overlapping wavelength regions, and ratios such as the ultraviolet-B to total ultraviolet (UVB:UV) photon ratio where the wavelength band used for the numerator is a spectral region within that used for the denominator. Ratios between non-overlapping regions can in principle take any unit-less numeric value in -\\inf\\ldots\\inf while ratios in which the numerator wavelength range is nested in the wavelength range of the denominator can take at most numeric values in 0\\ldots1.\nIt is also possible, although less common, to define ratios based on energy. It important to keep in mind that a photo ratio and an energy ratio based on the same wavelength ranges will differ. As seen for the conversion between photon and energy irradiances in section XXXXX, the conversion is possible only if the spectral irradiance is know as it is a function of wavelength. For example, based on a sunlight spectrum for the mid-morning in the Spring in Helsinki the UV-B:PAR photon ratio of 1.9 ‰ corresponds to an UV-B:PAR energy ratio of 3.2 ‰.\nFinally, photon to energy ratios are also in use. In this case the range of wavelengths used for the numerator and denominator are the same but the irradiance in the numerator is expressed as a flux of photons and that in the denominator as a flux of energy. As the energy per photon depends on wavelength, the photon to energy ratio increases with increasing wavelength.\nAlthough less accurate than a spectrum with higher wavelength resolution, ratios provide summaries that are easier to interpret and analyse, and in many cases also easier to measure. One should, however, be careful with the interpretation of ratios as they are coarse summaries. Ratios discard important information about the shape of the spectrum as a whole and consequently the relationship between photon ratios and biological responses frequently is interpretable only when regions of the spectrum are reasonably close to those in the daylight spectrum.\nIt is very important to conduct experiments under realistic environmental conditions, i.e., conditions relevant to the aims of a study. For studies to be relevant to plants growing outdoors, these conditions include the daylight spectrum, while in contrast, for controlled environment farming, a good match to the spectrum of the artificial light used.\nFor the assessment and control of experimental conditions, it is helpful—besides using biologically effective irradiances and exposures—to calculate photon ratios to assess the similarity or not of illumination. Photon ratios inform succinctly about differences among experimental conditions or between experimental conditions and\nAs for example shown in section 8.2.7 on page and in table [tab:typical:irrad:values] on page. For the calculation of these ratios, it is essential to use the same quantity of radiation or the same weighting procedure, i.e. energetic units or photon units for the ratios being compared.\n\n6.6.1 A practical example\nThe importance of indicating the type of sensor and its orientation is exemplified by the changing ratio of fluence rate to irradiance throughout a day (Figure [fig:fluence:rate:irradiance]). At noon, when the sun is high in the sky the ratio is at its minimum. Even then the ratio remains larger than one because, other than at the equator, the midday sun never reaches the zenith and because the sensor will also always receive diffuse radiation from the whole sky. We can say that when measuring solar radiation the fluence rate will always be numerically larger than the irradiance. Towards both ends of the day the ratio reaches its maximum value because irradiance is being measured on a horizontal plane but the sun is near the horizon. During twilight, particles in the atmosphere will make the distribution of solar radiation more even, allowing a relatively large area of the sky to remain bright, and the ratio decreases again.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n6.6.2 Measuring fluence rate and radiance\nSpherical sensors, as needed for measuring fluence rate, also called scalar irradiance, are not common. LI-COR (Lincoln, NE, USA) sells a spherical quantum sensor (LI-193) that can be submerged, and Biospherical Instruments Inc. (San Diego, CA, USA) makes both PAR- (e.g. QSL-2100 and QSL-2200, terrestrial; QSP series with models that can be submerged to thousands of metres) and also narrowband spherical sensors for measuring UV- and visible radiation fluence rate. Biospherical Instruments Inc. also makes radiance sensors with input optics that have a very narrow acceptance angle. Figure [fig:AMOUR:entrance:optics] shows the different entrance optics available for one series of sensors from Biospherical Instruments. Most broadband UV sensors and entrance optics for spectroradiometers follow a cosine response. L. O. Björn (1995) describes a method for estimating fluence rate from three or six irradiance measurements at a series of specific angles.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n6.6.3 Sensor output\nRadiometer sensors can have either analog or digital outputs. Some sensors with an analogue output have an amplifier next to the detector, others do not. Sensors with an analog output are usually connected to a voltmeter or a datalogger. Some digital sensors are really complete radiometers with a digital output. Examples of radiometers with digital outputs, are shown in Figure [fig:AMOUR]. RS-232 and USB are digital interfaces frequently used to attach these sensors to personal computers[^19].\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n6.6.4 Calibration\nTo calibrate radiation sensors the relationship must be determined between the electrical signal produced by a sensor and the amount of radiation impinging on that sensor. The physical value of irradiance, , of the incoming radiation in energy units, is obtained by “comparison” of a measurement X with that of a calibrated radiation source X_\\mathrm{lamp}, {E_{\\mathrm{}}}= {E_{\\mathrm{lamp}}} \\cdot \\frac{X\\cdot a}{X_\\mathrm{lamp}} where {E_{\\mathrm{lamp}}} is the calibration file of the lamp provided by the calibration survey. The factor a accounts for any difference in the lamp to sensor distance between the survey’s calibration and your own measurement of the lamp. In most modern instruments this “comparison” is implicitly done by the software in the instrument itself, or the computer it is attached to, by multiplying the electrical signal from the detector with a calibration constant. If this is not the case, it is necessary to correct all raw measurements, here X and X_\\mathrm{lamp}, before making any further calculations, for example, by subtracting the measurement of dark current (the sensor reading in the dark).\nAlthough photons can be counted using a photomultiplier and appropriate electronics, this approach does not provide an absolute measurement. Some photons are always missed and false counts are included due to thermal excitation. Therefore, absolute calibration of radiation meters can only be provided in energetic terms. For this purpose so-called “blackbody radiators” of known temperature are used, since they depend only on temperature for the total radiation as well as its spectral distribution. Blackbody radiators used for the calibration of lamps, are then available for purchase by scientists for use as secondary standards.\nIn the case of broadband sensors used to measure biologically-effective irradiances or selected bands of the spectrum, the calibration is usually carried out by comparison to readings from a calibrated spectroradiometer under a radiation source with a spectrum as similar as possible to the one which will be measured with the broadband sensor (e.g. sunlight). To calibrate spectroradiometers, in addition to a spectral-irradiance calibration against one or more lamps (with a continuous spectrum, such as an incandescent lamp), it is necessary to do a wavelength calibration against the sun or a lamp (with a an emission spectrum with discrete, narrow and stable peaks, such as a low pressure mercury lamp).\n\n\n6.6.5 Further reading\nL. O. Björn and Vogelmann (1996) treat the same subjects as this section, but in more depth.

    "text": "6.7 Actinometry\nActinometers are chemical systems for the measurement of light and ultraviolet radiation. They do not need to be calibrated by the user, and thus do not require the purchase of an expensive standard lamp with an expensive power supply. Standardization has usually been taken care of by those who have designed the actinometer. Another advantage is that their geometry can more easily be adjusted to the measurement problem. The shape of a liquid actinometer can be made to correspond to the overall shape of the irradiated object under study.\nIn many cases, it is of interest to study a suspension or solution that can be put in an ordinary cuvette for spectrophotometry or fluorimetry, and the actinometer solution can be put into a similar cuvette. A large number of actinometers have been devised. Kuhn, Braslavsky, and Schmidt (1989) lists, briefly describes and gives references for 67 different systems of which they recommend five. In general, actinometers are sensitive to short-wave radiation (&lt;500 nm) and insensitive to long-wave radiation (&gt;500 nm). Insensitivity to long-wave radiation can be both a drawback and an advantage, but by choosing the best actinometer for a particular purpose we can avoid their disadvantages. One advantage of using an actinometer insensitive to long wave radiation is that we can use it for UV work under illumination visible to the human eye, without disturbing the measurement. Here we shall concentrate on the most popular actinometer for ultraviolet radiation—the potassium ferrioxalate or potassium iron(III) oxalate actinometer. In addition to using it directly in some experiments, we can use it for checking the calibration of other instruments, such as spectroradiometers.\nThe description below is sufficient for a researcher starting to work in the field. For more detailed information one should consult Parker (1953; Hatchard and Parker 1956; Lee and Seliger 1964; Goldstein and Rabani 2008). Complete recipes have also been published, e.g., Seliger and McElroy (1965; Jagger 1967). In the ferrioxalate actinometer the following photochemical reaction is exploited:\n\n\\frac{1}{2} (COO)_2^{2-} + Fe^{3+} + photon \\rightarrow CO_2 + Fe^{2+}\nor\nOxalate ion + Fe(III) ion + radiation \\rightarrow carbon dioxide + Fe(II) ion\n\n\nThe quantum yield for this reaction (i.e., the number of iron ions reduced per photon absorbed) is slightly wavelength dependent but close to 1.26 in the spectral region, 250–500 nm, where the ferrioxalate actinometer is used. Usually a 1-cm layer of 0.006 M ferrioxalate solution is used. Quantum yield and the fraction of radiation (perpendicular to the 1 cm layer) absorbed are shown in Table [tab:ferrioxlate].\nAs seen from Table [tab:actinometer] the sensitivity of this actinometer (column to the right) is constant throughout most of the UV range, which makes it very convenient for our work.\nThe amount of Fe(II) formed can be measured spectrophotometrically after the addition of phenanthroline, which gives a strongly absorbing yellow complex with Fe(II) ions.\nThe ferrioxalate (actually potassium ferrioxalate) for the actinometer is prepared by mixing 3 volumes of 1.5 M potassium oxalate (COOK_{2}) with 1 volume of 1.5 M FeCl_3 and stirring vigorously. This step and all the following procedures involving ferrioxalate should be carried out under red light (red fluorescent tubes or LEDs). The precipitated should be dissolved in a minimal amount of hot water and the solution allowed to cool for crystallization (this crystallization should be repeated twice more). Potassium ferrioxalate can also be purchased ready-made, but the price difference encourages self-fabrication. The following is a recipe for the three solutions required to carry out actinometry (see Goldstein and Rabani 2008 for a different procedure and other quantum yields):\nSolution A: Dissolve 2.947 g of the purified and dried K_3Fe(III) oxalate in 800 ml distilled water, add 100 ml 0.5 M sulfuric acid, and dilute the solution to 1000 ml. This gives 0.006 M actinometer solution, which is suitable for measurement of ultraviolet radiation.\nSolution B: The phenanthroline solution to be used for developing the colour with Fe(II) ions should be 0.1% w/v 1:10 phenanthroline monohydrate in distilled water.\nSolution C: Prepare an acetate buffer by mixing 600 ml of 0.5 M sodium acetate with 360 ml of 0.5 M H_2SO_4.\nSolution A is irradiated with the radiation to be measured. The geometries of both the container and of the radiation are important and must be taken into account when evaluating the result. The simplest case is when the radiation is collimated, the container a flat spectrophotometer cuvette, the radiation strikes one face of the cuvette perpendicularly, and no radiation is transmitted. Even in this case one has to distinguish between whether the cuvette or the beam has the greater cross section, and correct for reflection in the cuvette surfaces. The irradiation time should be adjusted so that no more than 20% of the iron is reduced (this corresponds to an absorbance of about 0.66). In the following we shall assume that we use an ordinary fused-silica or quartz spectrophotometer cuvette with 10 mm inner thickness and containing 3 ml actinometer solution.\nAfter the irradiation and mixing of the actinometer solution, 2 ml of the irradiated solution is mixed with 2 ml of solution B and 1 ml of solution C, and then diluted to 20 ml with distilled water. After 30 minutes the absorbance at 510 nm is measured against a blank made up in the same way with unirradiated solution A. An absorbance of 0.5 corresponds to 0.905 \\mumol Fe^{2+}. It is a good idea to check this relationship with known amounts of FeSO_4 if you have not previously checked your spectrophotometer for accuracy and linearity. You should not use any absorbance above 0.65.\nExample of calculation: 3 ml of 0.006 M actinometer solution are irradiated by parallel rays of 300 nm UV-B impinging at right angles to one surface (and not able to enter any other surface). The radiation cross section intercepted by the solution is 2 cm^2. Five minutes of irradiation produces an absorbance of 0.6. This corresponds to 0.6 \\cdot 0.905/0.5 \\mumol = 1.086 \\mumol Fe^{2+}, but since we have taken 2 out of the 3 ml actinometer solution for analysis, multiply by 3/2 to get the total amount of Fe^{2+} formed. Throughout the UV-B region the quantum yield is 1.26, so this corresponds to absorption of 3 \\cdot 1.086/2/1.26 \\mumol photons. Reflection from the surface is estimated to be 7% (by application of Snell’s law, or law of refraction, giving the angle of refraction for an angle of incidence at the boundary of two media like water and glass). None of the radiation penetrates the solution to the rear surface, since the solution thickness is 1 cm. Therefore the incident radiation is 3 \\cdot 1.086/(1.26 \\cdot 0.93 \\cdot 2) \\mumol = 1.390 \\mumol radiation incident on 2 cm^2 in 5 minutes, and the photon irradiance (quantum flux density, in this case equal to the photon fluence rate, since the rays are parallel and at right angles to the surface) is 1.390/(2\\cdot5) \\mumol/cm^2/min = 0.1390 \\mumol/cm^2/min = 10000 \\cdot 0.1390/60 \\mumol/m^2/s = 23.2 \\mumol/m^2/s.\nA. D. Kirk and Namasivayam (1983) point out errors that might arise if a more concentrated actinometer solution is used, in order to absorb more light at long wavelengths, and how these errors can be minimized. If an actinometer much more concentrated than 0.006 M is used, the quantum yield is lower, and we do not recommend this for UV research. Goldstein and Rabani (2008), using 0.06 M actinometer solution, find almost the same quantum yield (1.24) from 250 to 365 nm, but much higher (1.47) from 205 to 240 nm; the latter in marked contrast to the values of Fernández, Figuera, and Tobar (1979) in the table above, so measurements below 250 nm should be regarded with caution. Bowman and Demas (1976) warn against exposure of the phenanthroline solution to UV, and even against the fluorescent room lighting.\nChemical or biological systems (mostly in a solid state) for recording solar radiation and particularly radiation, are widely employed for estimating the exposure of people, leaves in a plant canopy, and other objects which for various reasons are not easily amenable to measurements with electronic devices. These chemical devices are generally referred to as dosimeters rather than actinometers, even if there is no defined delimitation between these categories. As the construction, calibration, and use of chemical and other dosimeters have been the subject of frequent reviewing (Bérces et al. 1999; Horneck et al. 1996; Marijnissen and Star 1987), we shall not dwell on them here, only stress that their radiation sensitive components can be either chemical substances (natural such as DNA or provitamin D, or artificial) or living cells (e.g., various spores and bacteria).",

    "section": "6.8 Dosimeters",
    "text": "6.8 Dosimeters\nBroadband dosimeters have been developed to quantify exposure to UV radiation based either upon the photochemical degradation of chemical compounds and plastic films or using biological techniques involving damage to DNA. The range of experimental methods has been described by Dunne (1999) and A. Parisi et al. (2010). The most practical and effective dosimeters for plant studies include the use of plastic films of polysulphone (PS) and poly 2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide (polyphenylene oxide or PPO) (see Geiss 2003; A. Parisi, Schouten, and Turnbull 2010) and the determination of spore viability after UV exposure (see e.g. Quintern et al. 1992, 1994, 1997; Furusawa et al. 1998).\nA commercially available UV-dosimetry system ‘Viospor’ (Biosense, Germany) uses the DNA molecules of microbial spores immobilised in a film mounted in a protective casing with a cosine corrected filter system to provide a measurement of biologically-weighted UV exposure (Figure [fig:UV:dosimeters:VS]). Viospor sensors are available as two types: Viospor blue-line types I-IV which provide estimates of the CIE erythemal exposure (as MED, J m-2, and SED) at a range of exposure levels from seconds to several days, and Viospor red-line which use the DNA damage action spectrum (Setlow 1974) to estimate the DNA damaging capacity of UV-B and UV-C radiation and the efficiency of UV-C germicidal lamps. After exposure, films are incubated in bacterial growth medium to stimulate spore germination and the production of proteins that are stained for densitometric quantification. Exposed dosimeters are returned to the supplier for analysis (BioSense, Dr. Hans Holtschmidt, Laboratory for Biosensory Systems, Postfach 5161, D-53318 Bornheim, Germany. phone: +49-228-653809, fax: +49-228-653809, mailto:mail@biosense.de, internet: http://www.biosense.de).\n\n \n\nSmall dosimeters have also been constructed from 30–45 film of the thermoplastic polysulphone and can be used to determine exposure by measuring the increase in absorbance at 330 nm (Geiss 2003; A. Parisi et al. 2010) ideally using an integrating sphere to minimise the effects of scattering (Figure [fig:UV:dosimeters:PS]). Dosimeters can be calibrated in sunlight by comparison with erythemally-calibrated broadband radiometers or against lamp sources using a double monochromator spectroradiometer. Ideally, the calibration should be determined under field conditions appropriate for plant studies and if calibrated outside in sunlight the calibration is only accurate under the prevailing atmospheric ozone column as this modifies the UV spectrum. An erythemal dose can be calculated from 40 polysulphone film using a relationship of the form (see Geiss 2003):\n\\mathrm{Radiation\\ amount}\\ ({\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}}})  = 8025\\, (\\Delta \\mathrm{A}_{330})^2 + 1980.8\\, \\Delta \\mathrm{A}_{330}\nwhere is the absorbance at 330 nm before exposure (which should be between 0.105 and 0.133) minus the absorbance at 330 nm after exposure plus a further 24 h in the dark. The film may also be calibrated against other action spectra.\nAccuracy of polysulphone dosimetry has been reported to be \\pm10% if is &lt;0.3 but decreases to \\pm30% for up to 0.4 (Diffey 1987). Greater variability in occurs with increasing duration of exposure and dosimeters saturate at sub-tropical sites in less than one day. However, they have also been modified with a filter to provide an extended dynamic range of exposure (over 3 to 6 days) without the need to replace the dosimeter due to saturation (Alfio V. Parisi and Kimlin 2004). Polysulphone dosimeters have been combined with a PAR dosimeter to investigate the visible and UV radiation environment of plants (A. V. Parisi, Wong, and Randall 1998; A. V. Parisi, Galea, and Randall 2003) and miniature versions have also been developed: 1.5~{\\mathrm{cm}} \\times 1.0~{\\mathrm{cm}} with an exposure of a 6 mm disc of polysulphone (A. Parisi et al. 2010).\n\n \n\nFor longer exposure periods, dosimeters using an alternative plastic film, PPO, have been found more suitable as they saturate at sub-tropical locations after 5–10 days. The change in absorbance of PPO is quantified at 320 nm and it has been successfully calibrated to erythemal exposures (Lester et al. 2003) and by using a mylar (polyester) filter for estimation of UV-A exposures (Turnbull and Schouten 2008). Both PS and PPO dosimeters have been investigated for underwater use where PPO has been considered viable when calibrated under water (but not using a calibration in air) and under the relevant ozone column conditions of the study (Schouten, Parisi, and Turnbull 2007, 2008). The duration of use of PPO dosimeters in air at sub-tropical locations has been extended from 5 to 10 days by the use of neutral density filters (A. Parisi, Schouten, and Turnbull 2010; Schouten, Parisi, and Turnbull 2010).\nThe use of properly calibrated UV dosimeters can be particularly valuable in plant studies when long-term use of spectroradiometers and broadband radiometers is restricted by availability of electrical supplies or by physical constraints.",

    "text": "6.9 Thermopiles\nMost thermopiles have a flat response to (energy) irradiance across a wide range wavelengths. They are arrays of thermocouples formed between two different metal alloys. In a thermopile some couples are painted white and some black (or some other arrangement is used to generate a temperature difference dependent on absorbed energy), and the difference in temperature induced by the absorption of radiation by the black regions generates an electrical signal. A single thermocouple produces a very small signal, but connecting them in series generates a large signal that is easier to measure. Thermopiles can be either small for use in the laboratory or larger, and protected by a quartz dome for use in the field. Thermopile pyranometers are used to measure solar radiation in the range 285 to 2800 nm. Examples of such instruments are the pyranometers in the CMP series from Kipp & Zonen. Thermopile pyranometers are standard instruments in weather stations. Thermopiles can be also used to measure the (energy) irradiance of monochromatic radiation, including radiation, if the dome or ‘window’ is made from an transparent material.",

    "section": "6.10 Broadband instruments",
    "text": "6.10 Broadband instruments\nUV broadband radiometers integrate over either the UV-A or UV-B band or both, which encompasses the entire UV region of daylight. The names broadband and narrowband refer to the width of the ‘window’ or range of wavelengths to which a sensor responds. The term full-width half-maximum (FWHM) is used to measure this, it means the width of the peak in units of wavelength, measured at half the maximum height of the peak along the y-axis (with the output of the sensor on the y-axis plotted on a linear scale). A narrow band-pass can have a 10 nm or 20 nm FWHM while a wide one can have an 80 nm FWHM for instruments measuring a combination of UV-A and UV-B radiation.\nTheir low cost, fast response (typically milliseconds to seconds), stability and low maintenance requirements make them suitable for continuous monitoring applications. The most common spectral response is one that follows the erythemal action spectrum defined by the Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage, or CIE, (McKinlay and Diffey 1987; A. R. Webb et al. 2011), which describes the response of the human skin to UV radiation (Figure [fig:action:spectra], on page ).\nHowever, erythemally effective can be derived from most UV measuring instruments if the radiation spectrum is known and fairly stable in time such as when measuring sunlight. Hence, in meteorology the UV index is taken as a common factor that should be obtained from the data at every measuring site. Vice versa, using a correction factor to the instrument’s output, actual erythemal irradiance in effective can be calculated. Data from UV broadband instruments are part of a worldwide UV database that is located in the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC) as a part the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) programme of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).\nAs the spectral response of broadband radiometers only approximately follow the needed for the desired response, their use for measuring different radiation sources requires source-specific calibration. The readings of broadband radiometers calibrated for sunlight should not be used to assess doses from lamps without using correction factors obtained by calibration. For measuring lamps and LEDs the use of a spectroradiometer is strongly recommended.\n\n6.10.1 Principle of operation\nThe basic design of broadband instruments has not changed significantly since the introduction of the first erythemally weighted solar radiometer, the Robertson-Berger meter (Robertson 1972; Berger 1976). When direct and scattered solar radiation is transmitted through the transmitting quartz dome, the most common way to obtain an erythemal weighting is to filter out nearly all visible light using -transmitting black-glass blocking filters. The remaining radiation then strikes a sensitive fluorescent phosphor to convert UV-B light to visible light, i.e. green light emitted by the phosphor. This light is filtered again using coloured glass to remove any non-green visible light before impinging on a gallium arsenic or a gallium arsenic phosphorus photodiode used as detector.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nA thermally stable amplifier converts the diode’s output current to a voltage. It drives a line amplifier that provides a low impedance 0 to +4 V DC output signal. Phosphor efficiency decreases by approximately 0.5% K^{-1} and its wavelength response curve is shifted by approximately 1 nm towards the red every 10 K. This latter effect is particularly important because of the slope of the solar radiation curve at these wavelengths. The glass filters, phosphor and photodiode are held at 25 to 50, depending on the manufacturer, to ensure that the output signal is not sensitive to changes in ambient temperature. Temperature stabilization is usually achieved by an internal thermistor that permits independent monitoring of the sensor’s temperature (Figure [fig:Yankee]). The analogue electrical signal produced by the broadband UV instrument is converted into digital format for electronic logging. The sampling frequency is usually between once per second (1 Hz) and once per minute. If the complete data set is not stored then data are saved as averages over periods ranging from 10 minutes to not more than one hour. Sometimes, the variation around the mean is also recorded for each averaging period. This indicates the constancy of the conditions during the averaging period (e.g. sun screening by rapidly changing cloud cover: broken clouds or clear sky or constant cloudiness). The raw signal must be converted into units of erythemal irradiance () using a calibration factor, plus several corrections. These corrections require additional data: solar zenith angle () and ozone column depth at the time of measurement.\nErythemal effective irradiance () is calculated (A. Webb, Gröbner, and Blumthaler 2006): {E_{\\mathrm{CIE}}} = ({U_{\\mathrm{}}}- {U_{\\mathrm{d}}}) \\cdot k \\cdot f({\\theta}, {\\omega}) \\cdot f({T_{\\mathrm{}}}) \\cdot {\\varphi} Where: {U_{\\mathrm{}}} is the measured electrical signal from the radiometer, {U_{\\mathrm{d}}} is the electrical offset for dark conditions, k is the calibration coefficient, a constant value determined for specific conditions, e.g. at of 40and a total ozone column of 300 DU[^20]. f({\\theta}, {\\omega}) is a function of the solar zenith angle () and the total column of ozone (), i.e. the function can be expressed as a calibration matrix (or look up table) and is derived as part of the calibration procedure. It is normalized at a solar zenith angle of 40and a total ozone column of 300 DU. For solar zenith angles less than 40, f({\\theta}, {\\omega}) is often nearly unity. f({T_{\\mathrm{}}}) is the temperature correction function. It is recommended that the instrument is temperature stabilized. If this is not applicable then a correction should be applied, which is complex and not always successful. {\\varphi} is the cosine correction function (if necessary, otherwise =1).\nThe quality of the broadband instrument depends on the quality of the protective quartz dome, the cosine response, the temperature stability, and the ability of the manufacturer to match the erythemal curve with a combination of glass and diode characteristics. Instrument temperature stability is crucial, with respect to both the electronics and the response of the phosphor to the incident UV radiation.\nMore recently, broadband instruments are using thin film metal interference filter technology and specially developed silicon photodiodes to measure UV erythemal irradiance. This overcomes many problems connected with the phosphor technology, but on the other hand they have difficulties related to very low photodiode signal levels and filter stability. Silicon carbide () photodiodes have good sensitivity to radiation and are intrinsically blind to visible radiation.\nOther broadband instruments use one of these measurement technologies to measure other regions of the spectrum by using either a combination of glass filters or interference filters. Some manufacturers of these instruments provide simple algorithms to approximate erythemal dosage from the unweighted measurements (WMO 2008).\nThe maintenance of broadband instruments consists of ensuring that the domes are cleaned, the instrument is level, the desiccant (if provided) is active, and the heating/cooling system is working correctly, if so equipped.\n\n\n6.10.2 Some commonly used terrestrial instruments\nThe most common outdoor broadband radiometers are: SL 501 from Solar Light, Inc. (Glenside, PA, USA), YES UVB-1 from Yankee Environmental Systems, Inc. (Turners Falls, MA, USA), UVS-E-T (erythemal), UVS-A-T (UV-A) and UVS-B-T (UV-B) from Kipp & Zonen (Delft, The Netherlands) (Figure [fig:UV:pyranometers]). The principle of operation of these meters is basically the same as described in section 9.5.1. Unlike the other meters, the Scintec UV-S-290-T uses a Teflon diffuser under the quartz dome in front of the filters. These three instruments are temperature stabilized by means of heating elements and temperature sensors. Solar light also sells non-stabilized instruments like the PMA2101 (digital) and PMA1101 (analog), which contain a temperature sensor whose output can be used to correct in silico for the temperature dependency of the UV-B readings.\n\n  \n\nBroadband sensors based on special silicon photodiodes are also available, which, are more stable with respect to variation in temperature than those based on phosphors. Delta-Ohm (Padova, Italy), Delta-T Devices (Cambridge, UK) and Sky instruments (Llandrindod Wells, UK) make sensors based on this principle. Examples are the SKU 420, SKU 430, and SKU 440 (UV-A, UV-B, and erythemal, respectively) from Sky Instruments, LP UVA 01/03 and LP UVB 01/03 from Delta-Ohm, and UV3pB-05 and UV3pA-05 from Delta-T devices (Figure [fig:UV:diode:sensors]). All of them are UV radiometers with no temperature stabilization or in-built temperature sensors. International Light Technologies (Peabody, USA) makes a wide array of meters and sensors for measuring radiation. Vital Technologies used to make good UV sensors which were popular some years ago, but the company is no longer in business. Most of these sensors have built-in preamplifiers.\n\n \n\n\n\n6.10.3 Spectral and angular (cosine) response\nRadiation incident on a flat horizontal surface originating from a point source with a defined zenith position will have an intensity value proportional to the cosine of the zenith angle of incidence. This is called the ‘cosine law’ or ‘cosine-response’ (see section 9.1.2 on page ). Ideally, a pyranometer has a directional response, which is the same as the cosine-law. Nevertheless, directional response in a pyranometer is influenced by the quality, dimensions and construction of the (quartz) dome and/or Teflon diffuser. Pyranometer cosine-response is defined in their manufacturers specification as deviation from the ideal cosine-response using the incidence angle up to 80with respect to 1000 irradiance at normal incidence (0). Most sensors deviate considerably from ideal cosine response at angles between 80and 90.\nThe erythemal response of human skin to UV radiation varies with the individual, but for the global evaluation of UV-related health effects to succeed, broadband measurements have to be standardized, which means that the radiometric characteristics of all meters should be identical. The spectral response of every meter should follow exactly the same reference action spectrum and the angular response should not deviate from the cosine response (Leszczynski 2002). Hence, the spectral response of an ideal erythemally weighted radiometer should follow the CIE curve, and the angular response should follow the cosine function. Unfortunately, the angular and spectral response of real erythema meters are far from ideal; moreover, the characteristics vary from one meter unit to another, even within the same meter type (Leszczynski 2002).\nBroadband radiometers that do not follow the CIE erythemal action spectrum as are also used. For some radiometers the spectral response follows a bell-shaped curve centred on the UV-A or UV-B bands (see Figure [fig:UV:sensors:spectra]). Radiometers following the GEN or other spectra commonly used as BSWFs in research with plants, are very seldom used, and they are currently not available commercially. However, almost any UV-B radiometer can be calibrated to measure according to these BSWFs, but such calibrations are valid only when the calibration light source exactly matches the spectrum of the measured light source.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n6.10.4 Calibration and intercomparison\nEach broadband instrument used to measure solar or lamp radiation should be characterized for its spectral and angular response, and its sensitivity to temperature (and if possible humidity). These characteristics should be checked at regular intervals to determine their stability. Also, correction is necessary for each instrument, as no instrument has a spectral sensitivity identical to the erythemal action spectrum.\nTo calibrate a broadband instrument for solar radiation, the basic procedure is to simultaneously measure the spectral irradiance of the sun with a calibrated spectroradiometer and the broadband meter under cloudless sky conditions. The measured spectrum is weighted with the desired spectral sensitivity[^21] of the broadband meter and integrated over all wavelengths relevant for the broadband meter. The result is given in the units [detector-weighted ], relative to a defined wavelength, usually the maximum of the erythemal action spectrum (CIE) at 298 nm or the maximum of the spectral sensitivity of the broadband meter. For different atmospheric conditions, such as different solar elevation or different thickness of the ozone column, the relationship between the detector-weighted spectral integral, measured with a spectroradiometer, and the output of the broadband detector, after cosine correction, should be constant within the uncertainty estimate; if this is not the case, the mismatch indicates that the spectral sensitivity of the broadband meter deviates from the that used to calculate effective irradiances from the spectral irradiance data (e.g. that defined by the CIE standard for erythema), or that the spectroradiometric measurements were incorrectly done (Seckmeyer et al. 2005).\nWhen measuring the output from lamps using broadband sensors calibrated under sunlight, large errors are incurred. In the example shown in Table [tab:broadband:cal:errors], we use Kipp sensors because this manufacturer has published instrument spectral response data plotted on a logarithmic scale. Errors of a similar magnitude should be expected for equivalent sensors from other manufacturers. When measuring the irradiance from lamps under a background of sunlight as in some modulated systems, or when the spectrum changes as occurs when profiling the radiation change with depth in water bodies, other types of instruments like multiband sensors or spectroradiometers are preferable.\n\n\n6.10.5 UV radiation monitoring in growth chambers, greenhouses and phytotrons\nErythemal broadband instruments are widely used to monitor UV radiation levels in growth chambers. Great care must be taken when using such instruments for this purpose since plant action spectra generally deviate from the CIE function. In addition, the reflectance of walls and other surfaces of growth chambers may affect the readings if the cosine response is not good. Great care is needed when artificial light sources are used, because their spectra differ greatly from the solar spectrum for which broadband instruments are normally calibrated. Correction factors for the solar zenith angle and ozone dependence of the calibration factors are based on unfiltered solar spectra, so cannot be applied to measurements performed in such chambers, hence special treatment of data may be necessary. In most cases if absolute readings are needed, the broadband sensor should be calibrated against a double-monochromator spectroradiometer, for each different light source to be measured. Failing to do so can cause huge errors in the measurements of doses as shown in Table [tab:broadband:cal:errors].",

    "text": "6.11 Multi-channel filter instruments\nMultichannel instruments are radiometers that measure a series of fixed, usually narrow, wavelength bands of radiation. They are more rugged and cheaper than high quality spectroradiometers and easier to deploy. Each channel has its own detector (e.g. silicon photodiode) and filter (e.g. interference filters). Usually there is a single diffuser acting as common light collector for all channels. One example of a multichannel instrument is the GUV-2511 from Biospherical Instruments Inc (San Diego, USA) designed to measure cosine-corrected downwelling irradiance at 305, 313, 320, 340, 380, and 395 nm, as well as PAR (400–700 nm). When measuring daylight this allows to monitor UV radiation in key UV wavebands for biological exposure studies. These wavelengths also allow the extraction of cloud optical thickness and total column ozone, two critical variables used in modelling the solar spectrum. Multichannel sensors are mainly used for long-term monitoring of irradiance and its geographic variation. They are also used for ground measurements used to calibrate space-borne instruments carried by satellites.\nRecent multichannel instruments from Biospherical Instruments are modular. They are composed of microradiometers of small size, one for each channel, which together with input optics and filters are used to build the multichannel instruments.

It uses an integrating sphere to collect the light, which reaches the detectors after bouncing on the sphere walls. The autonomous version includes a built-in datalogger. It is waterproof, but it is not submersible. The underwater version is described in section 9.8.3 on page .\n\n\n\nimage",

Frequently, underwater measurements are referenced to the (spectral) irradiance at the surface of the water body, measured simultaneously with a matched “atmospheric” or terrestrial sensor.\nAs was mentioned in section 7.6 on page , measurement of the underwater UV field presents particular complexities, mainly related to variable attenuation occurring in different water bodies (J. T. O. Kirk 1994). Depending on the physical and chemical characteristics of the water, irradiance may decrease much more rapidly than irradiance (this phenomenon is known as ‘spectral leakage’), resulting in a changing spectrum with depth. Thus, underwater UV instruments are normally equipped with different filters and photodiodes to minimize these effects and to improve the sensitivity to particular wavelengths of interest. As discussed above in section 9.5.4 on page , errors are introduced if the spectrum being measured differs from that of the source used for calibration of the broadband instrument. This implies that when using broadband sensors underwater the errors will depend on the depth at which the radiation is being measured. In addition, a general problem exists for broadband sensors and spectrometers if sensors are only calibrated in air. The same calibration function cannot be used with the sensor in air and in water. Wavelength-dependent correction factors, so called immersion factors, must be used to adjust the signal if sensors are immersed in water as for example described by (Ohde and Siegel 2003).\nWater movement and weather conditions can affect the measurements of underwater UV radiation. For an accurate determination of UV radiation in the field, sunny, cloudless conditions and calm waters are preferred. The effect of waves may cause difficulties especially when measuring near the surface. On the other hand, clouds and other atmospheric UV absorbing phenomena can alter the conditions during the measurement of vertical light profiles, especially when the diffuse component of the beam is altered.\nSolar zenith angle is an important factor which affects the irradiance above the water surface, and also the reflectance of the water surface for the wavelengths of biological relevance. In addition, the RAF (RAF, see also section [sec:RAF]), can be used to estimate the effect of changes in the ozone column on biologically effective exposure. Corrections can be applied to measurements performed with broadband instruments, but measurements with narrow-band multi-filter instruments and spectroradiometers are less error prone.\nIf our objective is to describe the characteristics of the waters, radiation should be measured around solar noon, when solar elevation is maximal. However, if we are interested in describing the daily exposure of some organism, measurements should be done preferably during most of the day and at the depths of interest.\n\n\n6.12.2 Profiling\nProfiling is the measurement of irradiance or spectral irradiance as a function of depth in a water body. Special frames are used for lowering the instruments through the water. For light measuring instruments, the frame or rig should not occlude the field of view of the radiation sensors. A means of determining the depth at which the sensor is located, and any deviation from a vertical orientation should also be available. Suitable cabling is used to connect the underwater sensors to onboard computers or dataloggers.\n\n\n6.12.3 Underwater radiometers\nVarious underwater radiometers are currently available and their accuracy and characteristics vary considerably. The most appropriate instrument to choose depends on the specific goals of a study. Different types of radiometers include broadband radiometers, narrow-band multifilter radiometers, photodiode array spectroradiometers, and scanning spectroradiometers, including single monochromator spectroradiometers. Comparisons of the main characteristics of different types of instruments have been published (J. T. O. Kirk 1994; Díaz, Morrow, and Booth 2000; Kjeldstad et al. 2003; Tedetti and Sempére 2006). Some commonly-used underwater instruments are described below.\nThe ELDONET radiometers (Real Time Computer, Germany) were developed within the framework of the European light dosimeter network (Figure [fig:Eldonet]) and have been described in detail (Häder et al. 1999). The dosimeters are three-channel broadband filter devices with an entrance optic consisting of an integrating Ulbricht sphere with an internal BaSO_4 coating (Khanh and Dähn 1988). Silicon photodiodes (BPX60 for the PAR range and SFH291 for the two UV wavebands, both from Siemens, Germany) are used in combination with custom-made filters to select the wavelength ranges for UV-B (280–315 nm), UV-A (315–400 nm) and PAR (400–700 nm), a custom-made interference filter for UV-B (Janos Technology, Townshend, VT, USA), a DUG 11 band filter for UV-A (Schott & Gen., Mainz, Germany) and a broad band filter for PAR (WBHM, Optical Coating Laboratory, Santa Rosa, CA, USA). Eldonet performs 60 measurements each minute.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nSubmergible multichannel radiometers like PUV 500, PUV 2500 series from Biospherical Instruments (San Diego, USA) are equipped with narrow-band filter detectors in the range of UV and PAR (Figure [fig:PUV]). These radiometers are equipped with depth and temperature sensors and thus are well suited for accurate light profiling. The spectral characteristics of the five filters used in the PUV 500 instrument are as follows: 305\\pm1 nm (band pass 7\\pm1 nm) 320\\pm2 nm (band pass 11\\pm1 nm) 340\\pm2 nm (band pass 10\\pm1 nm) 380\\pm2 nm (band pass 10\\pm1 nm)\nOn the other hand, the PUV 2500 measures 7 (optionally 8) wavebands of downwelling irradiance (305, 313, 320, 340, 380, 395 nm and PAR: 400–700 nm) with one upwelling radiance channel (natural fluorescence). Each channel with 10 nm FWHHM except 305 (controlled by atmospheric ozone cutoff). The instrument includes pressure/depth sensing (350 m maximum) and temperature control. A 32 channel multiplexer selects signals from 8 photodetectors, temperature, pressure and tilt/yaw detector. The cosine collector is made of Teflon-covered quartz for use in the water.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nThe RAMSES family of hyperspectral radiometers (Trios GmbH, Germany) are miniature single monochromator spectrometers with a resolution of 2 to 3 nm per pixel and 100 or 190 usable channels in the photodiode array (Figure [fig:RAMSES]). They can be used in air or in water. The Ramses ACC-UV is an integrated UV hyperspectral radiometer, and the Ramses ACC-VIS is a and visible hyperspectral radiometer, both equipped with a cosine collector. Ramses ASC-VIS is equipped with a spherical collector shielded so as to measure radiation from one hemisphere. To measure scalar irradiance, two of these sensors can be deployed pointing in opposite directions. They are calibrated for underwater and air measurements (two different calibrations). The device has a small size, the signal capture requires some power consumption and portable (laptop) terminal at the surface. The detector type is a silicon photodiode array designed to capture wavelengths between 320–950 nm for VIS models and 280–500 nm for the UV models, with an irradiance accuracy better than 6–10% depending on the spectral range.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nAlthough the LI-1800UW instrument is not currently produced by LI-COR, many foundational studies focused on UV penetration during the 1980s and 1990s were carried out using this spectroradiometer. The optics of this scanning spectroradiometer is based on a single holographic monochromator grating, a silicon detector and a filter wheel to improve stray light rejection. The wavelength range is between 300 and 850 nm, with a bandwidth of 8 nm and accuracy of \\pm1.5 nm. Originally optional slits of different widths were available, so these specifications vary with the exact configuration used. The whole optical bench and the microcomputer system is contained in the massive waterproof housing designed for measurements to a depth close to 200 m. Being a single monochromator instruments its accuracy is limited by stray light when used to measure -B radiation in daylight.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nThe OL 754-O-PMT Spectrometer Optics Head (Optronic Laboratories) is based on a double monochromator for low stray light and measuring from 300 to 850 nm. Configurations with other gratings giving different wavelength ranges are available. The system utilizes holographic gratings with peak efficiencies at 300 nm. The instrument can be fitted with an OL IS-470-WP Submersible Sphere Assembly (4-inch integrating sphere) attached by means of quartz optical fibre to the non-submersible spectroradiometer. The sphere follows a dual port design with an entrance port and an exit port located 90^\\circ apart. The sphere contains an internal baffle in front of the exit port to permit only light reflected by internal surface of the sphere to exit the sphere and enter the fibre.\nAnother approach to measuring underwater radiation is to protect a regular sensor, as for example, those described in section 9.5.2 on page , within a hermetic water-proof housing (Figure [fig:sensor:in:box]). Of course the enclosure should have an transparent window, and the sensors must be calibrated inside the enclosure.",

    "text": "6.13 Modelling\nFor locations and times not covered by measurements, alternative approaches have to be considered for estimating the prevailing radiation conditions. For this purpose, various methods for modelling the surface UV radiation have been developed. These range from simple theoretical-empirical methods for estimating the clear-sky surface radiation to more sophisticated methods that account also for the effects of clouds as inferred either from ground-based station data or satellite measurements. Table [tab:modelling:methods] gives a simplified view of the main features of methods that are available for modelling the surface UV radiation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple theoretical-empirical methods, such as those of L. O. Björn and Murphy (1985) and Bird and Riordan (1986), have been widely used thanks to their fairly simple user interface. These methods provide spectral surface irradiances, optionally on tilted surfaces, and account for the main parameters affecting the surface radiation conditions under cloudless skies. Results indicate that they predict the surface radiation with reasonable accuracy as compared to more detailed radiative transfer calculations and measurements (Bird and Riordan 1986).\nAnother user-friendly alternative is to use an interactive web-based interface to radiative transfer simulations, such as the FastRT (Engelsen and Kylling 2005 available at http://nadir.nilu.no/~olaeng/fastrt/fastrt.html) or the QUICK TUV (http://cprm.acd.ucar.edu/Models/TUV/Interactive_TUV/). Both of these are based on rigourous radiative transfer models, which means that their accuracy depends mainly on the choice of values for the input parameters. Both include a selection of biological weighting functions, and FastRT also provides the possibility to account for the effect of clouds.\nWhen cloud effects need to be accounted for in detail, either satellite methods or so-called reconstruction methods should be considered. The reconstruction methods usually rely on ground-based measurements of some kind for accounting for the effect of clouds on radiation. Although the methods vary in their exact approach, the idea of all of them is to utilize available observations to account for the parameters that affect the amount of UV radiation reaching the surface. These parameters are, most importantly, clouds, total ozone column, surface albedo, atmospheric aerosols, and altitude or pressure. In addition, the solar zenith angle determines the path length of the direct:rad through the atmosphere and is therefore the single most important factor for the surface UV radiation. The Earth-Sun distance, which varies over the course of the year, also needs to be accounted for.\nMany station-based methods for reconstructing the surface radiation were included in recent European efforts to gain a better understanding of past radiation and its climatological behaviour (Koepke et al. 2006; den Outer et al. 2010). Similar methods have been proposed and applied in other parts of the world as well (V. I. Fioletov et al. 2001; V. E. Fioletov et al. 2004). Compared to satellite methods, the advantage of the station-based methods is that they tend to give more accurate estimates of the surface UV radiation. In particular, methods using (300–3000 nm), measured by pyranometers at numerous stations worldwide, as input for determining the cloud effect typically show small bias and fairly small scatter when compared to measurements (Koepke et al. 2006). To mention one example, Anders Lindfors et al. (2007) estimated daily erythemal UV doses at four Nordic stations, and found a systematic difference of between 0 and 4%, depending on the station, and a root-mean-square error of 5–9% as compared to measurements for the summer period.\nSatellite methods are based on radiative transfer simulations combined with information on, for example, clouds and total ozone column retrieved from the satellite observations. Satellite retrieved UV irradiances typically show an overestimation of 10% or more, and a large scatter, when compared to surface measurements: the root-mean-square errors for daily erythemal UV doses tends to be of the order of 30–40% (Kujanpää, Kalakoski, and Koskela 2010; Tanskanen et al. 2007; A. Lindfors et al. 2009). The main part of the overestimation is usually attributed to aerosol absorption, which is not accounted for properly in current satellite UV algorithms. The advantage of satellite methods, on the other hand, is their large geographical coverage, often global, and easy access to data that they provide.\nMost methods, both station-based UV reconstruction methods and satellite methods, only provide UV data corresponding to a selection of weighting functions (e.g., erythemally weighted ), and, in addition, sometimes irradiances for selected wavelengths. Furthermore, the methods typically include only irradiances for a horizontal surface. This may become an obstacle for biological applications where, for example, a specific weighting function or spectral information would be preferred. In principle, however, many of the methods could be extended to produce spectral irradiances and fluence rates. On the other hand, fluence rates can also be estimated based on the horizontal irradiance (e.g., Kylling et al. 2003).\nRecently, Anders Lindfors et al. (2009) presented a method for modelling spectral surface irradiances. The method relies on radiative transfer simulations, and takes as input (1) the effective cloud optical depth as inferred from pyranometer measurements of global:rad; (2) the total ozone column; (3) the surface albedo as estimated from measurements of snow depth; (4) the total water vapour column; and (5) the altitude of the location. Figure [fig:jok2001] shows a comparison between the daily accumulated irradiances at 300 and 320 nm from this method and measurements with a Brewer spectroradiometer at Jokioinen, southern Finland. At both wavelengths, the reconstructed irradiances closely follow the measured ones.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nA variety of methods for modelling the surface UV radiation are available. Which method is the best, or the most appropraite, depends on the specific question that is to be answered. In general, the complexity of the method tends to grow with increasing accuracy, and the pyranometer-based UV reconstruction methods, that are considered to provide highest accuracy, typically require an expert user. The use of such a method will, however, increase cross-disciplinary collaboration and may therefore be worthwhile.\n\n By ‘biologically effective irradiance’ we mean the irradiance weighted according to the effectiveness of different wavelengths in eliciting a photobiological response. The most frequently used biologically effective irradiance quantities are photometric quantities such as those described in Box [box:photometric:quantities] on page . In the case of photometric quantities the (energy) irradiance is weighted according to the response of the human eye.\nWhen studying the effects of radiation on plants we use as BSWFs (BSWFs) spectra describing the response of some plant function. For example an action spectrum for accumulation of flavonoids, or an action spectrum for growth inhibition. To be able to calculate biologically effective irradiances using any BSWF, we need to measure the spectral irradiance of the light source.\nIf we integrate the effective irradiance for the duration of an experiment then we obtain a biologically effective exposure (usually called ‘biologically effective dose’ by biologists). If we do the time integration for one day we obtain a biologically effective daily exposure.\nThese weighted irradiances are usually expressed using units corresponding to the underlying energy irradiances, independently of the BSWF used. Quantities calculated using different BSWFs are expressed in the same units, but the values cannot be compared because in reality they are measured on different scales.",

    "text": "6.14 BSWFs and effective UV doses\nThe emission spectrum of UV-B lamps, even filtered with acetate, is different to that of the effect of ozone depletion. The spectrum of the effect of ozone depletion not only changes with ozone column thickness, but also with solar elevation. In other words, it changes through a day and with seasons (Figure [fig:lamp:solar:spectra]). Because of this, it is almost impossible to exactly simulate the effect of ozone depletion in field experiments. The best we can do is to calculate effective doses.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nBiologically effective exposures (see Box [ex:effective:irradiance]) are a way of measuring radiation differing in spectral composition with the same ‘measuring stick’. This ‘measuring stick’ is a biological response. Behind each measurement we need to assume the involvement of a biological response. If we know the action spectrum for the biological response, we can use it as a BSWF: We multiply, wavelength by wavelength the spectral irradiance of the light source by the BSWF obtaining a weighted spectrum, giving a biologically-effective spectral irradiance (Figure [fig:eff:spectral:irrad]). We then integrate the result over wavelengths, to obtain a single number, the biologically effective UV irradiance[^26]. In Figure [fig:eff:spectral:irrad] it also possible to appreciate the difference in relative change of this effective irradiance, for a given level of ozone depletion, depending on the BSWF used.\nIt is important to make sure that both the irradiance and the effectiveness are measured using compatible units. It is common to express action spectra as spectral quantum effectiveness and to measure light sources as spectral (energy) irradiance. In research, biologically effective doses are most frequently expressed in weighted energy units and to be able to calculate these doses from spectral (energy) irradiance measurements for a light source (sunlight or lamps) one needs to use an action spectrum expressed in energy effectiveness. Most common formulations of action spectra need to be transformed from quantum effectiveness to energy effectiveness (one important exception is the CIE erythemal spectrum formulation). This is something that is often neglected, and is a source of difficulties when comparing doses between different publications.\nAnother possibility for measuring effective doses is to have a broadband sensor with a spectral response resembling the action spectrum of interest. In practice the spectral response of such sensors is only an approximation to the desired and consequently need to be calibrated under the light source to be measured, usually by comparison to a double monochromator scanning spectroradiometer (see section 9.7 on page ). Most such sensors are calibrated for sunlight, and consequently give biased readings when used for measuring radiation from most lamps.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nThe RAF () gives the percent change in effective dose () or, strictly speaking, effective exposure () for each percent change in ozone column thickness. It should be calculated using logarithms. \\mathrm{RAF} = \\frac{\\ln {H^{\\mathrm{d}}} - \\ln {H^{\\mathrm{n}}}}%\n        {\\ln [{\\mathrm{O_3}}]^\\mathrm{n} - \\ln [{\\mathrm{O_3}}]^\\mathrm{d}} where is dose and [{\\mathrm{O_3}}] ozone concentration, and superscript \\mathrm{d} indicates ozone depleted condition, and superscript \\mathrm{n} indicates normal, or reference, ozone depth condition. The value of depends strongly on the action spectrum used to calculate the effective dose. Looking at fig. [fig:eff:spectral:irrad], it can be understood why is much larger for GEN than for PG.\n\n6.14.1 Weighting scales\nUltraviolet action spectra are usually normalized to quantum effectiveness = 1 at 300 nm. This is arbitrary, and especially in the older literature, you will find action spectra normalized at other wavelengths. In the Materials and Methods section always report the normalization used, in addition to the action spectrum used as a BSWF. Remember that as the wavelength used for normalization is arbitrary, values of effective UV doses calculated using the same BSWF but normalized at different wavelengths cannot be directly compared because they are expressed on different scales. Of course biologically effective irradiances based on different BSWFs cannot be compared to each other either.\nUsing the correct BSWF is very important, as using the wrong BSWF has usually serious implications on the interpretation of experimental results (Martyn M. Caldwell and Flint 2006; Kotilainen et al. 2011).\n\n\n6.14.2 Comparing lamps and solar radiation\nFrequently we want to compare UV doses in growth chambers to doses outdoors. Unless we have a solar simulator the spectra will differ significantly. It is especially important to keep the ratio similar to that in solar radiation. Table [tab:UVeff] gives an example comparing a frame with two acetate-filtered Q-Panel UVB-313 lamps to sunlight with normal and 20% depleted ozone at Jokioinen for 21 May at 11:30.\n\n\n6.14.3 Effective doses, enhancement errors and UV-B supplementation\nUltraviolet-radiation supplementation can be modulated so as to follow natural variation in solar UV or just follow a daily square wave pattern (see section 8.2.6 on page ). It is important that lamps are filtered with cellulose di-acetate film (to remove UV-C radiation emitted by UV-B lamps, which is absent in natural sunlight) and that these filters are replaced regularly, specially in the case of square wave systems, as modulated systems with feedback compensate for the reduced dose automatically (although not for the change in spectrum) (Newsham et al. 1996). Even when adequately filtered the emission spectrum of UV-B lamps does not match the effect of depletion (Figure [fig:weighted:lamp:depl:GPAS:PG]. We need to calculate effective doses using BSWFs.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nErrors caused by the mismatch between the doses aimed at and those achieved when simulating the effect of ozone depletion with UV-B enhancement with lamps are called enhancement errors. The main source of these errors is the mismatch between the assumed spectral response and the real spectral response. This is so because the adjustment of the burning time (or power) of the UV-B lamps used for enhancement needs to be based on biologically effective doses. However, depending on the different BSWFs used, the needed lamp burning time may be long or short (Figure [fig:lamp:burning:times]). Another way of looking at this problem is to compare the deviation of the achieved when using a ‘wrong’[^27] BSWF compared to the target one—e.g. corresponding to a certain magnitude of ozone depletion. Figure [fig:achieved:CIE] shows this comparison for the frequent case of use of a CIE-weighted broadband sensor to control the lamps used in experiments with plants. The errors are surprisingly small for GEN and PG.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nAn additional source of errors is shading by the lamp frames. If we do not attempt to compensate for the shade with UV-B from the lamps the error between PG and GEN is small (Kotilainen et al. 2011). How much the effective UV dose decreases with shading does not depend on the BSWF used as long as the shade is ‘gray’ (equally affects all relevant wavelengths). However, how much UV from the lamps will be needed to compensate for this will depend on the BSWF used (Table [tab:shading:errors]). With some BSWFs the lamp power or burning time needed to compensate for shading is much more than that needed to simulate ozone depletion, because with spectra like PG, we need to replace shaded UV-A with UV-B from lamps. See section [sec:RAF] on page for a discussion of the relationship between changes in ozone column and changes in effective UV radiation.\nTo minimize shading errors we must build lamp frames that produce little shade. Probably &lt;\\!5% shading is achievable. We should not attempt to compensate for shading by the frames with UV from lamps. Shifting the whole experiment’s UV baseline dose by a small percentage but keeping the size of enhancement at the target level is probably the best approach available.",

    "text": "6.15 Effective UV doses outdoors: seasonal and latitudinal variation\nThe state of the atmosphere (in terms of ozone column thickness, cloudiness and aerosol content) together with day-length and daily course of the solar zenith angle () are the main factors determining the climatology of (and its components, and ) at ground level. For clear sky conditions the average spatial and temporal distribution of UV irradiance can be computed by means of a radiative transfer model fed with proper and aerosol data (Grifoni et al. 2008, 2009). In these conditions the latitudinal and temporal distribution of irradiance are driven mainly by two factors: day-length and through the day. See section 9.9 on page for a discussion of different approaches to modelling.\nTo go from the climatology of spectral irradiance to that of the biologically effective () exposures (or doses), spectral irradiance has to be weighted to account for the different efficiency of each wavelength in producing biological effects; this is done applying a BSWF—based on the action spectrum of the biological process considered. Plant action spectra differ in the weight given to and radiation, as it has been illustrated in section 7.8 on page . In this analysis Grifoni et al. (2009) considered two action spectra related to plant response: the so-called Generalized Plant Action spectrum (GEN, proposed by M. M. Caldwell 1971) and the more recent Plant Growth spectrum (PG, S. D. Flint and Caldwell 2003). The erythemal action spectrum (CIE, McKinlay and Diffey 1987) was also included since instruments with a spectral sensibility quite close to it have been used in several field experiments. The analysis presented in this section was based on spectral global irradiance for cloud-free conditions on horizontal surfaces simulated by means of the STAR model (Ruggaber, Dlugi, and Nakajima 1994; Schwander et al. 2000) for Rome, Italy (lat. 41.88 N, long. 12.47 E), Potsdam, Germany (lat. 52.40 N, long. 13.03 E) and Trondheim, Norway (lat. 63.42 N, long. 10.42 E) on the first day of each month of the year from 1:00 to 23:00 (UTC time) with a 30 min time step. Daily doses () were calculated for all these 12 days.\nAfter convoluting the spectral energy irradiances at ground level for the three locations and seasons with the three BSWFs, a picture of the seasonal of radiation was obtained, which was different depending on latitude. The pattern of seasonal and latitudinal variation of the daily doses is shown to depend strongly on the BSWF, and day of the year (Table [tab:doses:seasons]).\nThe changes in daily doses occurring through the year relative to the yearly average, for the three locations across Europe illustrate the effect of action spectra used as BSWFs (Figure [fig:doses:seasonal]).\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nThe largest seasonal variation occurs when the daily doses are computed on the basis of action spectra completely or partially excluding the contribution of the component, as in the case of GEN and CIE respectively. Figure [fig:doses:seasonal] shows the extent to which latitude affects these seasonal changes, which have a larger amplitude as the latitude increases. In other words, the climatology of appears to be strongly dependent on the action spectrum used, and, as different plant responses follow different action spectra, the effective climatology will depend on the plant response under study.\nThese differences in climatology are ecologically relevant, for instance for perennial species that may experience different seasonal change in the irradiance they are exposed to, depending on the latitude at which they are growing and on the biological process/action spectrum studied.",

    "text": "6.17 An accuracy ranking of quantification methods\nTable [tab:methods:accuracy] shows a preliminary comparison of different methods available for quantifying solar UV radiation and estimating biologically effective doses. Bias is the systematic directional deviation from the true value, for example overestimation of irradiance or doses. Uncertainty is a random deviation that prevents us from knowing the true value, but deviations are not systematic —measurements from different instruments or the same instruments after different recalibrations will deviate by different amounts and in different directions from the true value.\nA detailed comparison is difficult with the information currently available, consequently some gaps remain in the table. However, some general recommendations are possible. For outdoors experiments with manipulation of solar , the best option is most probably a combination of (a) hourly simulation of UV spectral irradiance with a model using ground station data as input, plus (b) spot measurements, for example under different filters with a spectroradiometer under clear sky conditions. It is best to replace modelling (a) with actual continuous measurements with a well calibrated double monochromator spectroradiometer. However, this is rarely possible in practice, as there are few ground stations producing validated spectral data.\nFor experiments using lamps, the best option from the point of view of accuracy is the use of a double monochromator spectroradiometer. From a practical viewpoint, using a broadband instrument calibrated against a double monochromator spectroradiometer, may be easier. When measuring mixed daylight and lamp radiation, or mixed radiation from diverse lamps, or when there is degradation of filters, broadband instruments are totally unsuitable.\nSingle monochromator spectroradiometers should be avoided for measurements of radiation when there is a background of or visible radiation, unless very special handling of stray light is done by a combination of special measuring protocols and data processing.",

To help in this process we present in Table [tab:typical:irrad:values] typical values for both unweighted and (energy) irradiance, photon irradiance, and biologically effective irradiances with the most frequently used BSWFs and wavelength normalisations. For radiation outdoors one can use a model (e.g. TUV quick simulator) to estimate spectral irradiance values and from them calculate effective doses or exposure.

    "text": "6.19 \nIn this section we list recommendations related to the quantification of radiation in experiments. See sections 8.6.1 and 8.6.2 for recommendations on manipulation of radiation, section 10.9 for recommendations about plant growing conditions, and section 11.12 for recommendations about statistical design of experiments.\n\nAlways report in your publications the radiation effective exposure (frequently called effective doses in the biological literature), depending on the type of experiment, as daily integrated values or effective irradiances plus daily exposure time. Calculate effective doses using relevant action spectra and if possible report doses using all the most commonly used ones: CIE, GEN(G), and PG.\nAlways indicate the name of the quantity measured, the type of sensor and its position during measurement, location of sensor with reference to plants, and unit of measurement. In the case of effective doses, indicate how they were calculated, in particular, cite the bibliographic source for the action spectrum and formulation used, and at which wavelength the spectrum was normalized to effectiveness equal to unity.\nWhenever possible include in your publications the emission spectrum of the light source and/or transmittance spectrum of the filters used, or cite an earlier paper where the spectra have already been published.\nUse only instruments with recent and valid calibration data for the measurements at hand.\nMake sure, in the case of broadband sensors, that the calibration is valid for the light source being measured. For example, broadband sensors calibrated for sunlight should not be used for measuring irradiance under lamps.\nIf high precision is required in the measurements, apply all the necessary corrections. This is important both for broadband and spectral measurements.\nBe aware of temperature effects on the functioning of the meter and sensor used and apply the required corrections or use temperature stabilized instruments.\nSingle monochromator array or scanning spectrometers can be used for measuring effective exposures in sunlight only with very serious limitations and only if complicated corrections are applied to the raw data to take into account stray light and the properties of the slit function. These corrections are not possible with the software provided by the makers of the instruments. Uncorrected measurements from this type of instruments are subject to huge uncertainties and, what is worse, bias. Use double monochromator spectroradiometers instead.\nWhen using spectrometers configured with SMA connectors for optical fibres, do not detach the fibre at the spectrometer end[^28][^29]. Doing so invalidates the calibration because the alignment of the fibre with respect to the entrance slit may be different after the fibre is reattached.\nWhen measuring, take into account the field of view of the entrance optics of your instrument (e.g. one hemisphere for a cosine corrected irradiance sensor) and make sure that yourself and any other nearby objects do not disturb the radiation ‘seen’ by the instrument.\nTake into account that spot measurements of in sunlight under different filters describe only one point in time. Continuous measurements or modelling based on continuous ground-based measurements are needed to fully describe the treatments applied.\nOutdoor irradiance is affected by cloudiness, so measurements where a single instrument is moved to take sequential measurements under the different treatments should be avoided unless the sky is perfectly clear. In addition, parallel measurement of PAR or global radiation in the open is recommended so as to be able to detect any variation due to clouds.\nexposure values (also called doses) derived from satellite-based measurements are subject to relatively large errors and bias, so it is better to avoid their use, specially when daily or weekly values are needed. Much of the uncertainty derives from the sparse nature of the satellite data (e.g. one or fewer fly overs per day).\nRoutinely check your instruments. Frequently check that the readings are very close to zero when the sensor is in darkness. Do sanity checks on your data against values expected (e.g. using models or published data). For example if when measuring a sunlight spectrum you get spectral irradiance values different from zero[^30] at wavelengths shorter than 290 nm you can be sure that there is a problem. There may be too much stray light, or a bad correction for the dark signal, or simply the spectrometer is not good enough for the job.\nWhen measuring sunlight or lamp spectra for calculating effective doses you need a spectroradiometer with a spectral resolution of at least 1 nm. Furthermore to reduce noise use only averaging of repeated scans rather than ‘Boxcar smoothing’. Boxcar smoothing reduces the spectral resolution by doing a moving average across wavelengths.",

    "section": "6.21 Appendix: Formulations for action spectra used as BSWFs",
    "text": "6.21 Appendix: Formulations for action spectra used as BSWFs\nThe calculation of biologically effective UV doses requires weighting the spectral energy irradiance () or spectral photon irradiance () at each wavelength with a weighting value that is typically generated from a mathematical formulation fitted to describe the weighting function or action spectrum of the biological process—i.e. a BSWF (BSWF). Data obtained from a spectroradiometer are usually provided as spectral energy irradiance (units: ) and care should be taken to use the appropriate formulation that uses either energy effectiveness () or quantum effectiveness () values as appropriate.\nThe usual approach is to base effective UV doses on energy irradiance data, using BSWFs that provide values for relative energy effectiveness at each wavelength. However, BSWFs are often defined using quantum effectiveness for application to photon irradiance values. Consequently, conversion of energy irradiance values measured during experiments to photon irradiance is necessary before applying weighting functions originally formulated using quantum effectiveness. Conversion of energy irradiance values to photon irradiance can be achieved using equation [eq:photon] on page . After conversion, the calculated effective doses will be on a different scale than if they are calculated based on energy irradiance values. Note that you may find examples in the literature where formulations based on quantum effectiveness () have been inappropriately applied to spectral energy exposure (unit: ) or spectral energy irradiance (unit: ).\nThe general plant action spectrum of Caldwell (Code GEN in Table [tab:action:spectra] on page ) was originally published simply as a graphical figure of quantum effectiveness against wavelength (M. M. Caldwell 1971) and subsequently two publications have fitted different mathematical formulations to describe its use as a weighting function. Green, Sawada, and Shettle (1974) fitted a function that decreases to zero at 313 nm whereas an alternative mathematical fit provided by Thimijan, Carns, and Campbell (1978) continues to weight irradiance values up to 345 nm in the region. Both of these functions are shown on Figure [fig:action:spectra] on page as GEN(G) and GEN(T) respectively. It is important to specify which mathematical function has been used when describing the calculation of effective UV doses in experimental methods.\nThe general plant action spectrum of Caldwell fitted with the mathematical function of Green, Sawada, and Shettle (1974) is given by (Source: L. O. Björn and Teramura 1993):\n{s_{\\mathrm{GEN(G)}}^\\mathrm{p}}(\\lambda) = \\begin{cases}\n           2.618 \\cdot \\left[ 1-\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{313.3}\\right)^2 \\right] \\cdot %\\cr\n\\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{\\lambda-300}{31.08}} & \\text{if $\\lambda\\le313.3$ nm}\\\\\n0 & \\text{if $\\lambda&gt;313.3$ nm}\n\\end{cases} \\label{eq:GEN.G}\nand when fitted with the mathematical function of Thimijan, Carns, and Campbell (1978) is given by (Source: L. O. Björn and Teramura 1993):\n{s_{\\mathrm{GEN(T)}}^\\mathrm{p}}(\\lambda) = \\begin{cases}\n\\mathrm{e}^{-\\left(\\frac{265-\\lambda}{21}\\right)^2} & \\text{if $\\lambda\\le345$ nm}\\\\\n0 & \\text{if $\\lambda&gt;345$ nm}\n\\end{cases} \\label{eq:GEN.T}\nThe DNA damage formulation of Green and Miller (1975) is given by:\n%\\qeff[DNA(GM)](\\lambda) & = & \\exp\\left\\{ 13.82 \\cdot \\left[ \\left( 1+\\exp\\left( \\frac{\\lambda-310}{9} \\right)\\right)^{-1} -1 \\right] \\right\\} \\label{eq:DNA.GM}\n{s_{\\mathrm{DNA(GM)}}^\\mathrm{p}}(\\lambda) = \\mathrm{e}^{ 13.82 \\cdot \\left[ \\left( 1+\\mathrm{e}^{ \\frac{\\lambda-310}{9}} \\right)^{-1} -1 \\right] } \\label{eq:DNA.GM}\nThe doses calculated with this formulation differ significantly from doses calculated using tabulated values derived from the figure in Setlow (1974). For example the model TUV and the data from the NSF monitoring network use the tabulated values rather than the formulation by Green and Miller (1975).\nHowever, most BSWFs are conventionally used with a value of one at 300 nm. This may be achieved by simple calculation adjustments within a spreadsheet (by dividing each wavelength effectiveness by the effectiveness value at 300 nm) or by altering the mathematical formula directly. Thus, the mathematical formulation of Green, Sawada, and Shettle (1974) for GEN(G) requires equation [eq:GEN.G] to be multiplied by 4.596 to normalize it to a value of 1 at 300nm and similarly GEN(T) requires equation [eq:GEN.T] to be multiplied by 16.083 and DNA(GM) requires equation [eq:DNA.GM] to be multiplied by 30.675.\nThe formulation of the weighting function published by S. D. Flint and Caldwell (2003) for plant growth, shown as PG in Figure [fig:action:spectra] on page , was for quantum effectiveness and already provides normalization to 1 at 300 nm and is given by:\n%\\qeff[PG](\\lambda) & = & \\cases{\\mathrm{e}^{4.688272\\ \\cdot\n% \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{e}^{0.1703411 \\cdot \\frac{\\lambda-307.867}{1.15} +\n%\\left(\\frac{390-\\lambda}{121.7557}-4.183832\\right)}}} & if $\\lambda\\le390$ nm\\cr\n%0 & if $\\lambda&gt;390$ nm\\cr} \\label{eq:PG}\n{s_{\\mathrm{PG}}^\\mathrm{p}}(\\lambda) =  \\begin{cases}\\exp\\left(4.688272\\ \\cdot \\right. \\cr\n\\left.\n\\ \\ \\ \\exp\\left(-\\exp\\left(0.1703411 \\cdot \\frac{\\lambda-307.867}{1.15}\\right)\\right) + \\right. %\\cr\n\\left.\n\\left(\\frac{390-\\lambda}{121.7557}-4.183832\\right)\\right) & \\text{if $\\lambda\\le390$ nm}\\\\\n0 & \\text{if $\\lambda&gt;390$ nm}\n\\end{cases}\n\\label{eq:PG}\nSome weighting functions are already defined using energy effectiveness values for use with energy irradiance data, one example being the CIE erythemal action spectrum (McKinlay and Diffey 1987; A. R. Webb et al. 2011). The standard was revised in 1998 and the updated version should be used instead of the original one from 1987 (A. R. Webb et al. 2011). It is important to check that published mathematical formulae have been appropriately normalized to one at 300 nm. However, whereas most BSWFs are conventionally set to one at 300 nm, the CIE98 erythemal weighting function has defined values at specific wavelengths (A. R. Webb et al. 2011) and is given by:\n{s_{\\mathrm{CIE}}}(\\lambda) = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if $250\\le\\lambda\\le298$ nm}\\\\\n10^{0.094(298-\\lambda)} & \\text{if $298\\le\\lambda\\le328$ nm}\\\\\n10^{0.015(140-\\lambda)} & \\text{if $328\\le\\lambda\\le400$ nm}\\\\\n0 & \\text{if $\\lambda &gt; 400$}\n\\end{cases} \\label{eq:CIE}\nWeighting functions defined using quantum effectiveness (), and normalized to one at 300 nm, can be converted to relative energy effectiveness () simply by multiplication, wavelength by wavelength, of the quantum effectiveness by by the respective wavelength in nm and dividing by 300 (the chosen normalization wavelength in nm). The value 300 should be changed when using other wavelengths for normalization. This is based on equation [eq:photon] giving the energy in one photon, but as Planck’s constant (h) and the speed of light in vacuum (c) are constant divisors, and we are expressing the effectiveness in relative units, they can be left out of the calculation.\nIt is always essential to specify clearly the normalization wavelength, the mathematical formulation and the BSWF used when describing the calculation of effective UV doses.\n\n2\n\n6.22 Appendix: Calculation of effective doses with Excel\nLet us start with a text file generated by a spectroradiometer and its connected computer. With the instruments that I have used this text file consists of one column, containing either spectral (energy) irradiance or spectral photon irradiance (some instruments, especially for underwater use, may have fluence rate instead of irradiance). At the start, above the columns, is a heading containing supplementary information. Other instruments may have two columns, the first one containing wavelength values, the other one spectral irradiance values.\nFor the Optronics instruments that I have used, the start of a data file looks like the listing in Figure [fig:list:Optronics]. The heading here contains “a”, which in this case is the name of the file, the kind of data that is recorded (including the unit), the date, the starting wavelength in nm, the end wavelength (not shown here) in nm, and the step interval in nm. This file can be loaded into an Excel file going to Data&gt;Get external data&gt;Load text file. When you have done this, insert a new column to the left of the one containing the measured data. In this new column you should fill in the wavelength values, which can be done in the following way without typing every value:\n\n\n\"a\",\"Irradiance [W/(cm^2 nm)]\",971217,250.00,400.00,1.00\n1.439562E-010\n1.797497E-010\n6.126532E-010\n4.516362E-009\n8.027722E-009\n1.081851E-009\n2.862175E-010\n1.728253E-010\n1.790998E-010\n1.953554E-010\n2.570309E-010\n...\n\n\nType the first two values, i.e. in this case first “250” in the cell left of the one containing the first radiation value 1.439562E-010. Since the step interval is 1.00 nm, the next value is 251. Type this in the cell to the left of the value 1.797497E-010. Select the two cells that you have just filled in. Put the cursor at the lower left corner of the cell containing “251” and see it change appearance, push the (left) mouse button and drag down to the cell left of the last radiation value. The column will then fill up with the appropriate wavelength values.\nYou have now filled columns A and B with the appropriate values. Next you should generate a column with values of the weighting function. Suppose you wish to use the weighting function of S. D. Flint and Caldwell (2003). The formula given for this in the publication is Biologically effective UV= \\exp[4.688272*\\exp(- \\exp(0.1703411*(x-307.867)/1.15))+((390-x)/121.7557-4.183832)] in which x stands for wavelength in nm.\nSelect cells in column C over the rows corresponding to values in columns A and B. Go to “Tools” on top of the file, push the mouse button and go down and select “Calculator”. Type the formula above, with the exceptions that you use ordinary parentheses instead of square brackets, “A:A” instead of “x” (do not type the quotation marks), and comma instead of dot if you use the comma system. When this is done, press OK and save the result.\nYou now have the values of the weighting function in column C. If you double-click on the first value in column C you should get the equation entered. The top of your file should then look like Figure [fig:Excel:sheet]. If you insert a new column C to the left of your old column C and copy the wavelength values into it you can plot your weighting function as a check. If you plot it on a logarithmic abscissa, it should look something like Figure [fig:Excel:PG]. This can be compared to the plot in the original publication by S. D. Flint and Caldwell (2003). Once you have generated a weighting function that you wish to use several times, you need of course not calculate it like this every time. You can simply transfer the column with it to a new sheet or a new Excel file. Since, as newly generated, it depends on another column, you need to use the command “Paste special” and choose “values”.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nNow you are ready to do the weighting itself. Select cells in column E in rows corresponding to the values in the other columns. Select the Calculator, and use it to multiply values in column B with the weighting function. Select an empty cell and go a final time to the Calculator. Select “Sum” and then the values you have just generated in column E. The sum you get in the cell you selected is the weighted radiation value. The number is, in this case, 0.000334759 and the unit is W cm^{-2}, which can also be expressed as 3.35 . The bottom of the file should look like Figure [fig:Excel:sheet:bottom]. I have written \\Sigma in one cell to remember that the value to the right of it is the sum of the values above it.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nNote that if you have another step size than 1 nm, you must multiply the sum by that step size. It is recommended that you do not use step sizes greater than 1 nm for UV-B spectra, since both the spectra themselves and the weighting functions are so steep.\nMartyn Caldwell’s traditional Generalized Plant Action Spectrum is easier to handle, and you should be able now to do a similar exercise with it yourself. A formula for this weighting function has been published by Green, Sawada, and Shettle (1974): Weighting function = 2.618\\cdot[1 -( \\lambda/313.3)2]\\cdot \\exp[-(\\lambda - 300)/31.08], where \\lambda stands for wavelength in nm. We abbreviate the name of this action spectrum as GEN(G) elsewhere in this text. See section 9.17 on page for the equations for other commonly used BSWFs.\n\n\n6.23 Appendix: Calculation of effective doses with R\n\n6.23.1 Introduction\nIf you use the R system for statistics (see, http://www.r-project.org/), or if you need an implementation with fewer restrictions, you may want to use R instead of Excel to calculate doses and action spectra. R is based on a real programming language called S and allows much flexibility. We have developed a package to facilitate these calculations. The package is called ‘UVcalc’ and will be soon submitted to CRAN (Comprehensive R archive network) and will be available also from this handbook’s web page. In addition to functions for calculating weighted and unweighted doses, and irradiance and from energy irradiance spectra, also functions for calculating photon ratios are provided.\n\n\n6.23.2 Calculating doses\nCurrently functions for five are implemented and are listed in Table [tab:R:dose:functions]. The functions take two arguments one vector giving the wavelengths and another vector giving the values of spectral energy irradiance at these wavelengths. The spectral irradiance or spectral exposure values would come either from measurements with a spectroradiometer or from model simulations. All functions accept a wavelengths vector with variable and arbitrary step sizes, with the condition that the wavelengths are sorted in strictly increasing order, something which is especially convenient when dealing with data from array spectrometers[^31].\nThe functions are made available by installing the package UVcalc (once) and loading it from the library when needed. To load the package into the workspace use library(UVcalc). Then load your spectral data into R using read.table() or read.csv().\nA file from a Macam spectroradiometer starts:\nWavelength(nm),W/m2\n270,0\n271,0\n272,1.17E-04\n273,2.42E-04\n274,4.55E-04\n275,8.94E-04\n276,0.00161\n277,0.00263\n278,0.00412\n279,0.00621\n280,0.00904\n281,0.01697\n282,0.02069\n283,0.02663\n284,0.03314\n285,0.04075\n286,0.04895\n287,0.05817\n288,0.0679\nFor a file like this one, use the code below but replacing \"name\" with the name and path to the data file. On Windows systems you need to scape backslashes in file paths like this: ‘\\\\’.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nIf our spectral irradiance data is in , and the wavelength in nm, as in the case of the Macam spectroradiometer, the functions will return the effective irradiance in .\nIf, for example, the spectral irradiance output by our model or spectroradiometer is in m, and the wavelengths are in Ångstrom then to obtain the effective irradiance in we will need to convert the units.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nIn this example, we take advantage of the behaviour of the S language: an operation between a scalar and vector, is equivalent to applying this operation to each member of the vector. Consequently, in the code above, each value from the vector of wavelengths is divided by 10, and each value in the vector of spectral irradiances is divided by 1000.\nIf the spectral irradiance is in then values should be multiplied by 10 to convert them to .\nIt is very important to make sure that the wavelengths are in nanometers as this is what the functions expect. If the wavelengths are in the wrong units, the BSWF will be wrongly calculated, and the returned value for effective irradiance will be wrong.\nIf we use as input to the functions instead of spectral irradiances, time-integrated spectral irradiances in , then the functions will return the effective exposure, or ‘dose’ in . Such time-integrated values are more frequently available as the output of models, or by integrating observed sequential values of spectral irradiance.\nIn addition to the functions for calculating biologically effective doses and effective irradiances, we provide functions for calculating unweighted doses or irradiances of (PPFD() or PAR.q.dose(), and PAR.e.dose()), (UVA.q.dose() and UVA.e.dose()) and (UVB.q.dose() and UVB.e.dose()), where ‘e’ variants return energy doses, and ‘q’ variants return quantum or photon doses. All functions expect as input radiation spectra in energy units, and wavelengths in nm.\n\n\n6.23.3 Calculating an action spectrum at given wavelengths\nThe functions available for calculating action spectra take as argument a vector of wavelengths, and return a vector of effectiveness (either quantum=photon or energy based) normalized to unity effectiveness at a wavelength of 300 nm except when indicated. These functions are listed in Table [tab:R:action:spectra:functions], and an example of their use follows. In these examples we generate the wavelengths vectors in R, but they can be also read from a file.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nAll functions accept a wavelengths vector with variable and arbitrary step sizes, with the condition that the wavelengths are sorted in strictly increasing order.\n\n\n6.23.4 Calculating photon ratios\nFunctions are also provided for calculating photon ratios between different pairs of wavebands. These functions are listed in Table [tab:R:photon:ratios:functions]. We follow the most frequently used wavelength ranges for the different colours, but also provide some generic functions that can be used when other limits are needed. Continuing with the example above in which my.data was read and attached we calculate UV-B : PAR photon ratio\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nThe spectral energy irradiance, can be in any energy based unit such as , or , as the multipliers cancel out when calculating the ratio. However, wavelengths must be always expressed in nanometers. Please, be aware that these functions will return erroneous values if used with spectra expressed as spectral photon irradiance, even though the returned values are photon ratios.\nPlease, be aware that following common practice in the literature, the wavelength range used for red light is different for the different photon ratios.\n\n\n6.23.5 Documentation\nThe package includes manual pages for the different functions, and an overview and a list of references for the original sources used. The definition of the functions can bee seen once the package is loaded by entering the name of the function without parameters or parentheses.\nThere are many resources on the R-System for Statistics and statistics in general available on-line. The most useful ones are The R Wiki (http://rwiki.sciviews.org/), and the documentation included in all R installations and accompanying each one of the different packages.\nSome classical books on R are those by Dalgaard (2002), Crawley (2005, 2007), and William N.

    "text": "6.22 Appendix: Calculation of effective doses with Excel\nLet us start with a text file generated by a spectroradiometer and its connected computer. With the instruments that I have used this text file consists of one column, containing either spectral (energy) irradiance or spectral photon irradiance (some instruments, especially for underwater use, may have fluence rate instead of irradiance). At the start, above the columns, is a heading containing supplementary information. Other instruments may have two columns, the first one containing wavelength values, the other one spectral irradiance values.\nFor the Optronics instruments that I have used, the start of a data file looks like the listing in Figure [fig:list:Optronics]. The heading here contains “a”, which in this case is the name of the file, the kind of data that is recorded (including the unit), the date, the starting wavelength in nm, the end wavelength (not shown here) in nm, and the step interval in nm. This file can be loaded into an Excel file going to Data&gt;Get external data&gt;Load text file. When you have done this, insert a new column to the left of the one containing the measured data. In this new column you should fill in the wavelength values, which can be done in the following way without typing every value:\n\n\n\"a\",\"Irradiance [W/(cm^2 nm)]\",971217,250.00,400.00,1.00\n1.439562E-010\n1.797497E-010\n6.126532E-010\n4.516362E-009\n8.027722E-009\n1.081851E-009\n2.862175E-010\n1.728253E-010\n1.790998E-010\n1.953554E-010\n2.570309E-010\n...\n\n\nType the first two values, i.e. in this case first “250” in the cell left of the one containing the first radiation value 1.439562E-010. Since the step interval is 1.00 nm, the next value is 251. Type this in the cell to the left of the value 1.797497E-010. Select the two cells that you have just filled in. Put the cursor at the lower left corner of the cell containing “251” and see it change appearance, push the (left) mouse button and drag down to the cell left of the last radiation value. The column will then fill up with the appropriate wavelength values.\nYou have now filled columns A and B with the appropriate values. Next you should generate a column with values of the weighting function. Suppose you wish to use the weighting function of S. D. Flint and Caldwell (2003). The formula given for this in the publication is Biologically effective UV= \\exp[4.688272*\\exp(- \\exp(0.1703411*(x-307.867)/1.15))+((390-x)/121.7557-4.183832)] in which x stands for wavelength in nm.\nSelect cells in column C over the rows corresponding to values in columns A and B. Go to “Tools” on top of the file, push the mouse button and go down and select “Calculator”. Type the formula above, with the exceptions that you use ordinary parentheses instead of square brackets, “A:A” instead of “x” (do not type the quotation marks), and comma instead of dot if you use the comma system. When this is done, press OK and save the result.\nYou now have the values of the weighting function in column C. If you double-click on the first value in column C you should get the equation entered. The top of your file should then look like Figure [fig:Excel:sheet]. If you insert a new column C to the left of your old column C and copy the wavelength values into it you can plot your weighting function as a check. If you plot it on a logarithmic abscissa, it should look something like Figure [fig:Excel:PG]. This can be compared to the plot in the original publication by S. D. Flint and Caldwell (2003). Once you have generated a weighting function that you wish to use several times, you need of course not calculate it like this every time. You can simply transfer the column with it to a new sheet or a new Excel file. Since, as newly generated, it depends on another column, you need to use the command “Paste special” and choose “values”.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nNow you are ready to do the weighting itself. Select cells in column E in rows corresponding to the values in the other columns. Select the Calculator, and use it to multiply values in column B with the weighting function. Select an empty cell and go a final time to the Calculator. Select “Sum” and then the values you have just generated in column E. The sum you get in the cell you selected is the weighted radiation value. The number is, in this case, 0.000334759 and the unit is W cm^{-2}, which can also be expressed as 3.35 . The bottom of the file should look like Figure [fig:Excel:sheet:bottom]. I have written \\Sigma in one cell to remember that the value to the right of it is the sum of the values above it.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nNote that if you have another step size than 1 nm, you must multiply the sum by that step size. It is recommended that you do not use step sizes greater than 1 nm for UV-B spectra, since both the spectra themselves and the weighting functions are so steep.\nMartyn Caldwell’s traditional Generalized Plant Action Spectrum is easier to handle, and you should be able now to do a similar exercise with it yourself. A formula for this weighting function has been published by Green, Sawada, and Shettle (1974): Weighting function = 2.618\\cdot[1 -( \\lambda/313.3)2]\\cdot \\exp[-(\\lambda - 300)/31.08], where \\lambda stands for wavelength in nm. We abbreviate the name of this action spectrum as GEN(G) elsewhere in this text. See section 9.17 on page for the equations for other commonly used BSWFs.",

    "section": "6.23 Appendix: Calculation of effective doses with R",
    "text": "6.23 Appendix: Calculation of effective doses with R\n\n6.23.1 Introduction\nIf you use the R system for statistics (see, http://www.r-project.org/), or if you need an implementation with fewer restrictions, you may want to use R instead of Excel to calculate doses and action spectra. R is based on a real programming language called S and allows much flexibility. We have developed a package to facilitate these calculations. The package is called ‘UVcalc’ and will be soon submitted to CRAN (Comprehensive R archive network) and will be available also from this handbook’s web page. In addition to functions for calculating weighted and unweighted doses, and irradiance and from energy irradiance spectra, also functions for calculating photon ratios are provided.\n\n\n6.23.2 Calculating doses\nCurrently functions for five are implemented and are listed in Table [tab:R:dose:functions]. The functions take two arguments one vector giving the wavelengths and another vector giving the values of spectral energy irradiance at these wavelengths. The spectral irradiance or spectral exposure values would come either from measurements with a spectroradiometer or from model simulations. All functions accept a wavelengths vector with variable and arbitrary step sizes, with the condition that the wavelengths are sorted in strictly increasing order, something which is especially convenient when dealing with data from array spectrometers[^31].\nThe functions are made available by installing the package UVcalc (once) and loading it from the library when needed. To load the package into the workspace use library(UVcalc). Then load your spectral data into R using read.table() or read.csv().\nA file from a Macam spectroradiometer starts:\nWavelength(nm),W/m2\n270,0\n271,0\n272,1.17E-04\n273,2.42E-04\n274,4.55E-04\n275,8.94E-04\n276,0.00161\n277,0.00263\n278,0.00412\n279,0.00621\n280,0.00904\n281,0.01697\n282,0.02069\n283,0.02663\n284,0.03314\n285,0.04075\n286,0.04895\n287,0.05817\n288,0.0679\nFor a file like this one, use the code below but replacing \"name\" with the name and path to the data file. On Windows systems you need to scape backslashes in file paths like this: ‘\\\\’.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nIf our spectral irradiance data is in , and the wavelength in nm, as in the case of the Macam spectroradiometer, the functions will return the effective irradiance in .\nIf, for example, the spectral irradiance output by our model or spectroradiometer is in m, and the wavelengths are in Ångstrom then to obtain the effective irradiance in we will need to convert the units.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nIn this example, we take advantage of the behaviour of the S language: an operation between a scalar and vector, is equivalent to applying this operation to each member of the vector. Consequently, in the code above, each value from the vector of wavelengths is divided by 10, and each value in the vector of spectral irradiances is divided by 1000.\nIf the spectral irradiance is in then values should be multiplied by 10 to convert them to .\nIt is very important to make sure that the wavelengths are in nanometers as this is what the functions expect. If the wavelengths are in the wrong units, the BSWF will be wrongly calculated, and the returned value for effective irradiance will be wrong.\nIf we use as input to the functions instead of spectral irradiances, time-integrated spectral irradiances in , then the functions will return the effective exposure, or ‘dose’ in . Such time-integrated values are more frequently available as the output of models, or by integrating observed sequential values of spectral irradiance.\nIn addition to the functions for calculating biologically effective doses and effective irradiances, we provide functions for calculating unweighted doses or irradiances of (PPFD() or PAR.q.dose(), and PAR.e.dose()), (UVA.q.dose() and UVA.e.dose()) and (UVB.q.dose() and UVB.e.dose()), where ‘e’ variants return energy doses, and ‘q’ variants return quantum or photon doses. All functions expect as input radiation spectra in energy units, and wavelengths in nm.\n\n\n6.23.3 Calculating an action spectrum at given wavelengths\nThe functions available for calculating action spectra take as argument a vector of wavelengths, and return a vector of effectiveness (either quantum=photon or energy based) normalized to unity effectiveness at a wavelength of 300 nm except when indicated. These functions are listed in Table [tab:R:action:spectra:functions], and an example of their use follows. In these examples we generate the wavelengths vectors in R, but they can be also read from a file.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nAll functions accept a wavelengths vector with variable and arbitrary step sizes, with the condition that the wavelengths are sorted in strictly increasing order.\n\n\n6.23.4 Calculating photon ratios\nFunctions are also provided for calculating photon ratios between different pairs of wavebands. These functions are listed in Table [tab:R:photon:ratios:functions]. We follow the most frequently used wavelength ranges for the different colours, but also provide some generic functions that can be used when other limits are needed. Continuing with the example above in which my.data was read and attached we calculate UV-B : PAR photon ratio\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nThe spectral energy irradiance, can be in any energy based unit such as , or , as the multipliers cancel out when calculating the ratio. However, wavelengths must be always expressed in nanometers. Please, be aware that these functions will return erroneous values if used with spectra expressed as spectral photon irradiance, even though the returned values are photon ratios.\nPlease, be aware that following common practice in the literature, the wavelength range used for red light is different for the different photon ratios.\n\n\n6.23.5 Documentation\nThe package includes manual pages for the different functions, and an overview and a list of references for the original sources used. The definition of the functions can bee seen once the package is loaded by entering the name of the function without parameters or parentheses.\nThere are many resources on the R-System for Statistics and statistics in general available on-line. The most useful ones are The R Wiki (http://rwiki.sciviews.org/), and the documentation included in all R installations and accompanying each one of the different packages.\nSome classical books on R are those by Dalgaard (2002), Crawley (2005, 2007), and William N. Venables and Ripley (2002). The book by (W. N. Venables and Ripley 2000) discusses programming in S, the language used in R to build new functions and packages.",

    "text": "4.1.1 Position of the sun\nWhen studying plants we frequently need to describe the position of the sun because of its effect on spectral irradiance and as a determinant of day length. The azimuth angle (\\phi) is usually measured clockwise from the North on a horizontal plane. The position on the vertical plane is measured either as the zenith angle (\\theta) downwards from the zenith, or as an elevation angle (h) upwards from the horizon. Consequently h + \\theta = 90^\\circ = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\,radians. When describing the position of the sun as in Figure 4.1 the observer is situated at the origin of the system of coordinates used to describe the angles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Diagram showing the angles used to describe the position of the sun in the sky, viewed from the East. h: sun elevation angle, θ: zenith angle, Φ: azimuth angle.\n\n\n\nThe daily path of the sun in the sky depends on the time of the year and the latitude. The time of solar noon depends on the actual geographic location, and nearly always differs from the local-time noon which is based on a time zone and possibly affected by a shift of one or more hours to enhance daylight use, especially in summer time.\nHighly accurate astronomical formulas are available and can be used to compute the current, past and future positions of the sun in the sky (e.g., Meeus 1998). Less accurate, but simpler to compute, formulas also exist. These formulas can also be use to compute day- and night lengths based on different twilight definitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe accuracy of astronomical formulas is less when the sun is near the horizon because, as seen in the previous chapter, the transition from vacuum to the atmosphere introduces a small angular displacement of the light beam depending on the refractive index and angle of incidence. The difficulty is that the refractive index (\\nu) of the air depends on its water content, which is not constant.\n\n\nThe path of the sun in the sky determines the lengths of the day and night. The most frequently used criterion for the day to night and night to days transitions is that the upper rim of the solar disk coincides with the astronomical horizon. As the solar disk is approximately 2 degrees in diameter, the transition between day and night is in this case when the centre of the solar disk is one degree below the horizon. Alternatively, the centre of the solar disk can be used coinciding with the astronomical horizon can be used as the criterion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Position of the sun at sunrise, sunset, dawn and dusk. Figure by TWCarlson available at Wikimedia Commons under CC-BY-SA 3.0.\n\n\n\nTwilight is the period before sunrise and after sunset when there is more intense diffuse light than further into the night (Figure 4.2). The definitions of twilight are based on practical considerations of human activities, and called civil, naval and astronomical (Figure 4.3). During civil twilight artificial lighting is usually not needed in cities. For nautical twilight I have seen two descriptions: 1) before nautical dawn and after nautical dawn it is possible to navigate based on the stars, and 2) after nautical dawn and before nautical dusk navigation by sight is possible. Before astronomical dawn and after astronomical dusk stars of sixth magnitude are visible. These three descriptions are very approximate, as they do not consider the effect of clouds, light pollution from artificial sources, or other source of light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Criteria defining twilight based on the position of the sun. The angles when expressed as sun elevation (h) are negative. Only dawn and sunrise shown. The same angles are used between sunset and dusk. Figure by TWCarlson available at Wikimedia Commons under CC-BY-SA 3.0., edited\n\n\n\nThe day length through the year computed for three cities, one of them, Ivalo at the northern latitude within the Artic circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Day length through the year at different latitudes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we include twilight, the estimated length of the photoperiod increases (Figure 4.5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Photoperiod duration computed for sunrise/sunset or for dawn/dusk according to different twilight definitions. The curve describes the elevation angle of the sun through the day at Helsinki, Finalnd, on the 21 March 2024. The horizontal lines show the elevation angles used as the boundary of the “photoperiod” and the numbers above each of these lines give the corresponding length of the photoperiod in hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nEven though day length or photoperiod duration is normally based on the astronomical horizon, in many cases there are obstacles that occlude the sun from view until later at dawn or earlier at dusk: mountains, vegetation, buildings, etc. Thus, in some cases it may be more relevant for a scientific study with plants to consider sun elevation angles h &gt; 0 as the criterion; even different angles can be used for day start and day end.\nThe question remains of what light level is actually detected by plants and other organisms as the night-day and day-night transitions. Most likely the exact value depends on the genotype and the realized phenotype. However, at dawn and dusk irradiance increases and decreases, respectively, qquite fast at low and medium latitudes. At high latitudes, at some times the year twilight lasts for a long time making the change in irradiance more gradual. At civil dawn/dusk irradiance is already very low.\n\n\nThe dependency of the elevation angle on time of the year and latitude is illustrated in Figure 4.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: Sun elevation angle through the day at five different latitudes and four dates. The horizontal dotted lines show the horizon (h = 0). The range limits for the x and y axes are consistent across all plots.\n\n\n\n\n\nThree images from fig 3.6 in Graedel and Crutzen, 1993. Scanned. Have to be redrawn.\n  \nAdd links to previous chapter\n\n\n4.1.2 Solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere\nWe can measure irradiance outside the atmosphere at a know distance from the sun and we can also measure the apparent diameter of the sun at this same distance. Based on this we can calculate the total radiant energy emitted by the sun and irradiance at arbitrary distances.\nIn outer space, in vacuum, no scattering takes place as the light travels, and because of this, the sky looks completely black. Planets and the Moon do reflect light allowing us to see them. As the distance to the sun increases irradiance decreases as the flux spreads into a large area represented by the surface of a sphere, without scattering, this becomes a geometric computations in 3D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometric calculation\n\n\n\nThe spectral irradiance of the sun {E_{\\mathrm{s}}}(\\lambda) can be estimated assuming a homogeneous flux and using the correlation of intensity and radiance from their definitions in table [tab:Phys:Quants]. The intensity of the sun {I_{\\mathrm{s}}}(\\lambda) is given by the radiance {L_{\\mathrm{s}}}(\\lambda) multiplied by the apparent sun surface (a non-tilted disk of radius r_s=7\\times 10^5 km). To calculate the decreased solar irradiance at the top of the Earth’s atmosphere, the distance of the sun to the Earth (r_0=150\\times 10^6 km) has to be taken into account applying the inverse square law of irradiance of equation ([equ_r2law]). Thus, the extraterrestrial solar irradiance is\n{E_{\\mathrm{s}}}(\\lambda)={L_{\\mathrm{s}}}(\\lambda)\\cdot\\frac{\\pi r_s^2}{r_0^2} Remembering the solid angle of equation ([equ_solidangle]), the right multiplication factor represents the solid angle of the sun’s disk as seen from the Earth’s surface (\\approx 6.8\\times 10^{-5} sr).\n\n\nAt the time scales relevant to plants and humans, the distance between the Sun and the Earth varies little, as well as the emission from the surface of the sun. Thus, we can use a “solar constant” as a useful and nearly perfect approximation. The solar “constant”, the irradiance at the top of the atmosphere, varies between 1\\,361 and 1\\,362~\\mathrm{W m^{-2}} due to changes in solar activity. In addition to the irradiance, the shape of the solar spectrum at the top of the atmosphere varies very little in time, and is usually assumed constant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRadiation from the sun reaches the Earth’s surface in about eight minutes (t = time, r_0 = distance sun to earth, c = velocity of light in vacuum): t = \\frac{r_0}{c} \\approx \\frac{150 \\times 10^9 ~{\\rm m}}{3 \\times 10^8 ~\\frac{\\rm m}{\\rm s}} = 500 ~{\\rm s} = 8.3 ~{\\rm min}.\n\n\nThe energy radiance (L) of radiation emitted by the sun is similar in shape, but not identical, to the emission spectrum of a black body. The solar spectrum has a fine structure of peaks and valleys arising from the atoms and molecules in the sun while black body emission is described by a smooth curve. A “match” based on the wavelength at which spectral energy radiance is at its maximum can be used as criterion to estimate the temperature of the sun’s surface. Obviously, we use the extraterrestrial spectrum for this match. We see in the AM0 curve in Figure 4.11 that the wavelength at the maximum is near 500 nm. In reality the temperature of the sun surface is not uniform, and different sources mention as its average temperatures between 5800 K and 5500 K. Comparing the AM0 curve in Figure 4.11 to the 5800 K curve in Figure 4.7 the similary of their shapes is clear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: Radiance spectra for black bodies at three different temperatures; 5800 K (blue), 5000 K (orange) and 3700 K (red).\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanck’s law describes black body emission at temperature T (Figure 4.7), expressed as absolute temperature measured in degrees Kelvin (K):\nL_s(\\lambda,T) = \\frac{2hc^2}{\\lambda^5}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{e}^{(hc/k_\\mathrm{B}T\\lambda)}-1}\nwith Boltzmann’s constant k_\\mathrm{B}=1.381\\times 10^{-23} .\nThe “equivalent temperature” of a black body is given by Wien’s displacement law (Figure 4.8), which gives the wavelength at which the radiative energy emitted by a black body is at its maximum as a function of its absolute temperature.\n\\lambda_\\mathrm{max} \\cdot T = 2.898 \\times 10^6 \\,{\\rm nm\\,K}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.8: The peak wavelength of radiation emission by a black body as a function of its absolute (surface) temperature. The approximate temperature of the sun T_\\mathrm{sun} \\approx 5800\\,\\mathrm{K} is highlighted by a yellow-filled circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThe concept of “colour temperature” used for describing the emission of lamps used for illumination and more generaly in photography differs in that it takes into account human colour vision when determining the match between the black body emission spectrum and the spectrum of an arbitrary light source. The coordinated colour temperature (CCT) for the AM1.5 solar spectrum is 5231 K and for the AM0 spectrum is 5922 K.\n\n\nThe spectral irradiance of the sun {E_{\\mathrm{s}}}(\\lambda) can be estimated assuming a homogeneous flux and using the correlation of intensity and radiance from their definitions in table [tab:Phys:Quants]. The intensity of the sun {I_{\\mathrm{s}}}(\\lambda) is given by the radiance {L_{\\mathrm{s}}}(\\lambda) multiplied by the apparent sun surface (a non-tilted disk of radius r_s=7\\times 10^5 km). To calculate the decreased solar irradiance at the moment of reaching the Earth’s atmosphere, the distance of the sun to the Earth (r_0=150\\times 10^6 km) has to be taken into account due to the inverse square law of irradiance of equation ([equ_r2law]). Thus, the extraterrestrial solar irradiance is\n{E_{\\mathrm{s}}}(\\lambda)={L_{\\mathrm{s}}}(\\lambda)\\cdot\\frac{\\pi r_s^2}{r_0^2}\\label{equ_extraterrestrial} Remembering the solid angle of equation ([equ_solidangle]), the right multiplication factor represents the solid angle of the sun’s disk as seen from the Earth’s surface (\\approx 6.8\\times 10^{-5} sr). Figure [fig_sun] shows the spectrum of the measured extraterrestrial solar radiation (Wehrli, 1985)1 and the spectrum calculated by equation 1.14 using Planck’s law of equation 1.12 at a black body temperature of 5800 K. Integrated over all wavelengths, {E_{\\mathrm{s}}} is about 1361 to 1362 at top of the atmosphere (Kopp and Lean 2011). This value is called the ‘solar constant’. In former times, depending on different measurements, {E_{\\mathrm{s}}} varies by a few percent (Iqbal 1983). For example, the irradiance at the top of the atmosphere (the integrated value) changes by \\pm 50 (3.7 %) during the year due to distance variation caused by orbit excentricity (Mobley 1994). More accurate measurements during the last 25 years by spaceborne radiometers show a variability of the solar radiation of a few tenth of a percent. A detailed analysis is given by Fröhlich and Lean (2004). {E_{\\mathrm{s}}} can also be calculated by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: the total energy emitted from the surface of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature. For an isotropically emitting source (Lambertian emitter), this means {L_{\\mathrm{}}}= \\frac{\\sigma}{\\pi} \\cdot T^4 \\label{equ_boltzmann} with the Stefan-Boltzmann constant \\sigma=5.6705\\times 10^{-8} W m^{-2} K^{-4}. With T = 5800 K equation [equ_boltzmann] gives the radiance of the solar disc. From this value, we can obtain an approximation of the solar constant, by taking into account the distance from the Earth to the Sun and the apparent size of the solar disc (see equations [equ_solidangle] and [equ_r2law]).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.9: The extraterrestrial solar spectrum compared to black body emission. The black body emission spectrum has been scaled to match the energy irradiance of the solar spectrum at the top of the atmosphere (AM0) within the range of wavelengths shown.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total solar irradiance covers a wide range of wavelengths. Using some of the ‘colours’ introduced in table [tab:Waverange], table [tab_sun] lists the irradiance and fraction of {E_{\\mathrm{s}}} of different wavelength intervals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWaveband\nWavelength \\lambda (nm)\nIrradiance {E_{\\mathrm{}}} (W m^{-2})\nIrradiance {E_{\\mathrm{}}} (%)\n\n\n\n\nUV-C\n100 – 280\n7\n0.5\n\n\nUV-B\n280 – 315\n17\n1.3\n\n\nUV-A2\n315 – 340\n21\n1.6\n\n\nUV-A1\n340 – 400\n63\n4.7\n\n\nPhR\n400 – 700\n531\n39.6\n\n\nIR-A (CIE)\n700 – 1400\n517\n38.6\n\n\nIR-B (CIE)\n1400 – 3000\n184\n13.7\n\n\nTOTAL\n\n1339\n100.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Solar radiation at ground level\nAbove, we used the word light with its everyday meaning. Its technical definition is of radiation visible to humans. Ultraviolet, visible and infrared radiation (taken together are called in meteorolgy shortwave radiation) are components of solar radiation.\n\n4.1.3.1 Spectrum under clear sky\nWe could include a plot of scalar spectral irradiance (easy to generate with TUV) or of hemispherical spectral irradiance measured with a hemispherical diffuser (I have data). A comparison to spectral irradiance on a horizontal plane could be very informative.\nBefore reaching the Earth’s surface radiation from the sun travels through the atmosphere. The sun elevation angle affects the length of the path that the light arriving from the sun travels through the atmosphere. In atmospheric physics it is common to describe spectra as corresponding to AM0 for above the atmosphere, AM1 when the sun is at the zenith, i.e., one atmosphere thickness and AM1.5 when the length of the air mass traversed is 1.5 times that when the sun is at the zenith.\nThe air mass traversed is, in reality, not exactly proportional to the distance computed by trigonometry, but not far from it. An empirical formula (Kasten and Young 1989) can be used as a better approximation to the computation of AM values from the elevation angle (h) (Figure 4.10).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.10: Plot of the empirical relationship between sun elevation (h) or zenith anglr (\\theta) and “equivalent” atmosphere thickness traversed by solar radiation between outer space and the Earth’s surface (at sea level). AM1 is indicated by the horizontal dotted line.\n\n\n\n\n\nLight when travelling through the atmosphere interacts with the gases and particles composing it. The light is attenuated and scattered. Different wavelengths are differently affected by these processes, giving us a blue sky and warmer coloured direct sunlight. In other words, the daylight spectrum depends on the position of the sun in the sky, and on the composition of the atmosphere along this path (Figure 4.11 and Figure 4.12). In addition to molecular absorption and scattering, aerosols, both liquid like water and solid like ice and dust, interact with light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.11: The spectrum of solar radiation above the atmosphere (AM0) and a typical spectrum at ground level (AM1.5). Spectral energy irradiance for the wavelength range called shortwave radiation in meteorology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.12: The spectrum of solar radiation above the atmosphere (AM0) and a typical spectrum at ground level (AM1.5). Spectral photon irradiance for the range 250 to 900 nm.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe extraterrestrial solar spectrum differs from that at ground level due to the absorption of radiation by the atmosphere, because the absorption peaks of water, and other components of the atmosphere, cause corresponding valleys to appear in the solar spectrum at ground level. The solar spectrum has a much finer structure, due to emission and absorption lines of elements, this fine structure is not observable with the spectroradiometers normally used in plant research. For plant research, finr structure of peaks and valleys is considered irrelevant because plant pigments in vivo have broader peaks and valleys in their spectra.\nNot only total irradiance, but also the wavelength distribution and the diffuse fraction of the solar spectrum changes with the seasons of the year and time of day. This changes are in large part explained by the change in sun elevation. In what follows we describe these changes as a function of sun elevation. The increasing air mass traversed with decreasing sun elevation affects the shape of the spectrum, by stronger attenuation of the shorter wavelengths. An increased air mass also increases scattering in the atmosphere.\nA figure of spectral irradiance is difficult to read as both the shape of the curve and the maximum spectral irradiance change in parallel Figure 4.13.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.13: Change in spectral irradiance with sun elevation angle. Based on simulations with the TUV model for an ozone column of 300 DU under clear sky.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we rescale the curves to equal PAR irradiance the change in shape is easier to observe Figure 4.14.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.14: Change in scaled spectral irradiance with sun elevation angle.

UV-B irradiance decreases faster with decreasing sun elevation (h).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.16: Change in irradiance with sun elevation angle for different regions of the spectrum. PAR. orange, UVA-1. violet, UV-A2. purple, and UV-B. black. Based on simulations with the TUV model for an ozone column of 300 DU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3.2 Diffuse fraction under clear sky\nAt the Earth’s surface, the incident radiation or global radiation has two distinct components, direct radiation and diffuse radiation. Direct radiation is radiation travelling directly from the sun, while diffuse radiation is that scattered by the atmosphere. Diffuse radiation is what gives the blue colour to the sky and white colour to clouds. The relative contribution of direct and diffuse radiation to global radiation varies with wavelength and weather conditions. The contribution of diffuse radiation is more in the UV region, and in the presence of clouds (Figures [fig:sky:photos] and [fig:diffuse:UV]).\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nSimultaneous spectral measurements of direct and diffuse solar radiation are infrequent. Radiation transfer models such as TUV estimate these components, as shown in Figure 4.17. The diffuse fraction is larger at shorter wavelengths. Under overcast conditions or any other situation when the solar disk is fully occluded the diffuse fraction is equal to one. However, only in outer space the diffuse fraction approaches zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.17: Spectral energy irradiance under a clear sky and sun elevation of 45 degrees. Simulation with the TUV radiation transfer and atmospheric chemistry model for an ozone column on 300 DU, assuming a low optical density of aerosols. The black line shown total spectral energy irradiance, the orange-filled area is the direct component and the blue-filled area is the diffuse or scattered component.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 4.17 the spectrum at a single sun elevation is shown. In Figure 4.18 the diffuse fraction from simulations under the same atmospheric conditions are shown as a function of sun elevation. The diffuse fraction is largest for shorter wavelengths and for each waveband it increases as the sun elevation decreases. This change is not linear, and has a similar shape as the change in air mass traversed Figure 4.10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.18: Fraction of total radiation that is diffuse under a clear sky as a function of sun elevation angle. PAR, orange dashed; Red, red; Green, green; Blue, blue; UVA-1, violet; UV-A2, purple; UV-B, black. Based on simulations with the TUV radiation transfer and atmospheric chemistry model for an ozone column on 300 DU, assuming a low optical density of aerosols.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3.3 Ozone column\nThe spectral wavelength distribution is also modified by the amount of ozone in the atmosphere, known as the ozone column and measured in Dobson units (DU = mm of pure ozone) Figure 4.20. As expected, it is also affected by the air mass traversed, which depends on sun elevation. The UV-B:PAR photon ratior is more strongly dependent on the thickness of the ozone column at low sun elevations, when the ratio it smallest Figure 4.20.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate change and ozone depletion\n\n\n\nAn increase in the UV-B and UV-A2 irradiance is caused by depletion of the ozone layer in the stratosphere, mainly as a consequence of the release of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), used in cooling devices such as refrigerators and air conditioners, and in some spray cans (see Graedel and Crutzen 1993). The most dramatic manifestation of this has been the seasonal formation of an “ozone hole” over Antarctica. It is controversial whether a true ozone hole has already formed in the Arctic, but strong depletion has occurred in year 2011 (Manney et al. 2011) and atmospheric conditions needed for the formation of a “deep” ozone hole are not very different from those prevalent in recent years. Not so dramatic, but consistent, depletion has also been observed at mid-latitudes in both hemispheres. CFCs and some other halocarbons have been phased out following the Montreal agreement and later updates. However, as CFCs have a long half life in the atmosphere, of the order of 100 years, their effect on the ozone layer will persist for many years, even after their use has been drastically reduced. Model-based predictions of changes in atmospheric circulation due to global climate change have been used to derive future trends in index and ozone column thickness (Hegglin and Shepherd 2009). In addition, increased cloudiness and pollution, could lead to decreased global irradiance, sometimes called ‘global dimming’ (e.g. Stanhill and Cohen 2001).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.19: Change in scaled spectral irradiance with sun elevation angle.

Data from Anders Lindfors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3.4 Clouds\nAbove we have ignored the effects of clouds and relied heavily on simulations for clear-sky conditions. Next we will consider the effect of clouds and use as examples measurements and simulations that include the effect of clouds. We will consider variation at different time scales. We start with a time series of hourly mean spectra for one day, scaled to equal PAR photon irradiance to illustrate how the shape of the spectrum can change during the course of day Figure 4.21.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.21: Time series of scaled spectral photon irradiance during one day. Hourly mean spectra scaled to PAR = 1000 \\mu mol\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-2} to emphasize the change in shape. Simulated with libradtran including the effect of clouds for Kumpula, Helsinki, Finland. Data from Andes Lindfors.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that, through reflection, broken clouds can locally increase irradiance to values above those under clear-sky conditions (Frederick et al. 1993; Díaz et al. 1996). These are transient increases of short duration and easily detected with fast measurements, and the irradiance increase can be 30% or more compared to under a clear sky. This is well illustrated by measurements at 1 min interval during four consecutive days Figure 4.22.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.22: Time course of PAR, UV-A and UV-B photon irradiance during four consecutive days with different cloud conditions. Measured with broad band-sensors at Viikki, Helsinki, Finland. The values plotted are 1 min means from measurements once every 5 s. The step changes at very low sun elevations are caused by shading from far-away buildings.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe photon ratios for the same four days Figure 4.23 shows the influence of clouds and of sun elevation, both affecting the PAR diffuse fraction. In particular, broken clouds on 10 July cause momentary nearly doubling of the UV-A:PAR and UV-B:PAR photon ratios. The short-term effect on the R:FR is smaller, but the differences between days larger, possibly because of its dependence on the atmospheric water content (kotilainenxxxx?).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.23: Time course of red:far-red, UV-A:PAR and UV-B:PAR photon ratios during four consecutive days with different cloud conditions. Measured with broad band-sensors at Viikki, Helsinki, Finland. The values plotted are 1 min means from measurements once every 5 s; data shown for sun above the horizon. The step changes at very low sun elevations are caused by shading from far-away buildings. The PAR diffuse ratio varies with sun elevation in the range 0.12 to 1.0, as shown in Figure 4.18 for clear sky conditions. With the solar disk fully occluded by clouds or objects the diffuse ratio approches 1 at all sun elevations.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 4.23 we can see fast changes in the ratios towards the end of the day. The time-series of spectra measured once a minute during 5 minutes shows how the shape of the spectrum can rapidly change leading to rapid changes in the R:FR photon ratio Figure 4.24.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.24: Time series of spectra near sunset. Five minutes of solar spectra measurements. Measured with an array spectrometer at Viikki, Helsinki, Finland.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe low irradiance periods interspersed with higher irradiance ones, caused by moving clouds intermittently occluding the sun, or cloud flecks, have a haphazard dynamics that is very dependent on the cloud type and wind conditions. One way of describing them is by estimating an empirical probability density function for their duration Figure 4.25. The distribution is not Normal, and skewed to the right. Semi-transparent and small clouds attenuate irradiance less that large thick clouds and at the same time create cloud flecks of shorter duration Figure 4.25.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.25: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. In the main panel a quantile regression is shown, with the line repesenting the median, the dark band enclosing the two central quantiles (simmilar to the box in a box plot) and the pale band enclosing 90% of the observations. The inset shows the fitted empirical density function (EDF) for the duration of the cloudflecks. Source Sellaro et al. (2024).\n\n\n\n\n\nIrradiance is much lower under cloud cover than in full sunlight under a clear sky Figure 4.26. The cloud light spectrum is shifted towards shorter wavelengths, i.e., shade light is bluer (or cooler) than full sunlight, more easily seen after scaling the spectra to equal irradiance Figure 4.26. For this example the coordinated colour temperature (CCT) was 6190 K and 5580 K for the overcast and clear sky, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.26: Spectra during and immediately after a cloudfleck. A: photon spectral irradiance as measured, B: same data scaled to equal PAR of 1\\,000 \\mu mol\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-2}. Source Sellaro et al. (2024).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3.5 Elevation\nWe have three options: 1) generate suitable data with TUV, 2) show measured data from the literature, or 3) both.\nA simulation with the TUV model shows how attenuation by the atmosphere decreases with increasing ground altitude under a clear sky, with all other parameters kept unchanged, including surface albedo. As above, we show the actual spectral irradiance and the spectral irradiances scaled to equal PAR photon irradiance. The effect is not huge and the decrease in attenuation is stronger at shorter wavelengths Figure 4.27.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.27: Spectra under clear sky and a sun elevation of 45 degrees at different ground altitudes. A: photon spectral irradiance as computed with the TUV model, B: same data scaled to equal PAR of 1\\,000 \\mu mol\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-2}.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 4.27 we show the spectra for two extreme altitudes, sea level and 8000 m above sea level. In Figure 4.28 we show the increase in UV-B, UV-A2, UV-A1 and PAR with ground altitude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.28: Increase in PAR and UV irradiances at ground level under clear sky as a function of ground altitude above sea level. Based on spectral simulations with TUV for sun elevation 45 degrees. UVA-1, violet; UV-A2, purple; UV-B, black.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn reality, the different variables shown individually in the examples in this chapter, can vary in ways that their effects add up, so the total range of variation is larger than is apparent in the examples above.\n\n\n4.1.3.6 Seasons and latitude\nThe main determinant of changes in spectral irradiance with seasons and latitude is the changing path of the sun through the sky, and consequently of the sun elevation angle. However, several other variables play a role. The depth of the ozone column varies with latitude and seasonally. Clouds and the water column depth vary locally and with latitude, as does ground elevation and albedo. The result is that spectral irradiance varies in time and space. One way of summarising this is to describe the local climatology using maps with monthly averages over several years interpolated over a geographic grid. One approach is to use data retrieved by instruments on board satellites. An alternative approach is to describe terrestrial solar radiation at locations where ground-level measurements are available. We start with examples based on this second approach and observations with broadband sensors from ELDONET. From the perspective of research with plants the availability of UV-B, UV-A and PhR data measured concurrently is important.\nConsidering a longer time scale of years, seasonal and daily variation are combined. The seasonal pattern of variation in UV-B daily exposure is very clear but has day to day variation superimposed Figure 4.29. The strong change in the UV-B:PAR photon ratio with sun elevation creates a strong seasonal pattern in this photon ratio Figure 4.29.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.29: Seasonal variation in daily UV-B energy exposure Erlangen, Germany (54^\\circ 10^\\prime \\mathrm{N}, 07^\\circ 51^\\prime \\mathrm{E}, 280 m asl). A: daily UV-B energy exposure; B: UV-B:PhR daily-energy-exposures ratio. Note: there are gaps with missing data in the time-series data. Measured with ELDONET instruments (see, Häder et al. 2007).\n\n\n\n\n\nUV-B irradiance increases with elevation in mountains and with decreasing latitude Figure 4.30 and is particularly high on high mountains in equatorial regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.30: Latitudinal variation in annual UV-B and UV-A energy exposure in the Northern Hemisphere. Measured with ELDONET instruments. The ground altitude for these locations varies (see, Häder et al. 2007).\n\n\n\n\n\nI have data for 2-3 years time series measured with the same sensors as the four days plot above. Could be added as they include separate measurements of UV-B, UV-A2, UV-A1, blue, red, far-red and PAR irradiances. Maybe a figure with daily averages per month or week or showing a moving average or moving median could be informative. What do you think?\nMaps for global radiation, UV-B, and UV-A could be added to this section. The daily data are available on-line on a 1/2 degree grid for the last &gt;10 years. Some biologically effective exposures are also available. This is a lot of data. I have already downloaded the last 12 months. Downloading the whole time series with worldwide coverage and computing long-term means would be doable I think, but time consuming. For the time being here are maps for UV-B and UV-A with monthly means of daily doses for the whole world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.31: Monthly means of daily doses of UV-B. Daily data from 2023-10-01 to 2024-09-30 on a 0.5 by 0.5 degrees grid were used to compute monthly means. Grey areas in the map correspond to continuous night or low sun elevation at solar noon, which prevent remote sensing. Under these conditions UV-B irradiance is very low or null.

    "text": "9.1 Cameras\nMost photography cameras aim at producing images that reproduce a scene as seen by humans. When producing colour images image sensors with three channels are used, with sensors with designed to mimic the spectral sensitivity of the three photoreceptors participating in human day-time vision. This also applies to colour films (and video, TV and colour printing). In the case of greyscale (= black and white, BW) photographic films and very few digital cameras the images produced aim at reproducing the brightness of an scene as seen by humans. In other words, photograpoc cameras are designed to work as proxies for human vision.\nCameras used in industrial automation (= “machine vision”), astronomy, microscopy, etc., frequently use the same of similar image sensors as photography cameras, but exceptions are more common. Momochrome cameras are abundant and NIR cameras rather abundant. Cameras for UV are available and exceptionally, cameras for UV-B and even UV-C. Thermal IR cameras, designed for temperature measurements are monochromatic and sensitive to radiation in the range 8\\,\\mu m to 14\\,\\mu m (for -20^\\circ\\mathrm{C} to 1500^\\circ\\mathrm{C}), 0.85\\,\\mu m to 1.1\\,\\mu m (for 450^\\circ\\mathrm{C} to 1800^\\circ\\mathrm{C}, used for hot metal), and other variants.\nSpectral cameras cover the VIS wavelength range with more than three “colour” channels. Hyperspectral cameras frequently cover a wider range of wavelengths and have high wavelength resolution, i.e., they measure a spectrum for each pixel in the acquired image. Most of the these cameras cover the VIS and/or NIR but not UV.\nWith static subjects it is possible to acquire the images for the different wavelengths sequentially, even using black and white film or a monochromatic digital camera. This is how some early colour photography techniques were implemented using band-pass filters under sunlight or white light, and persisted mainly in reproduction work. Alternatively, in a darkened space, light of different colour can be used for illumination to the same effect.",

    "text": "10.2 Digital photography cameras\nThe cameras sold for photography are self contained: all controls, viewfinder and/or live-view screen, image review and image data storage all take place in-camera, and cameras are battery powered. Most cameras for ordinary photography are designed for imaging reflected visible light. In a few cases, manufacturers have offered versions of these cameras for use in forensics, with extended wavelength range. The sensors used are natively sensitive to shorter and longer wavelengths but optical filters attached to them limit the wavelngth range. Depending on the camera the shortest wavelengths that are detected vary between 380 nm and 410 nm, and the longest ones between 680 nm and 730 nm. The filters used are usually absoptive ionic and the cut-in and cut-off, specialy at the NIR end, are gradual, i.e., it is possible to use a 720 nm long-pass filter in most cameras but only by increasing exposure by orders of magnitude. Most of these cameras have colour sensors with red, green and blue filters on individual pixels. Currently, there are three monochromatic (or greyscale) system cameras in this group: Leica xxx, Pentax xxxx and xxxx.\nIt is possible to convert cameras to “full spectrum” (meaning the native sensitivity of the sensor) or alternatively a to especific range of wavelengths by replacing the filter that is built onto the image sensor. For a “full spectrum” conversion quartz or a long-pass filter with cut-in at 280 nm is used as replacement. This type of conversion involves disassembling the camera but is rather simple, and costs between 200 € and 500 € depending on the camera model and who does the conversion. The inherent sensitivity of image sensors is lower in the UV than in VIS, but at the NIR end it remains high up to 800 nm or longer.\nIn a “full spectrum” conversion, the sensor itself in not modified, and the RGB filters remain on the sensors pixels. Several companies, both is the USA and in Europe offer conversions, but not all are equally reliable. The conversion of a colour camera into a monochrome camera is much more difficult and exists a risk of damaging the sensor making it unusable, as it involves the removal filters that are part of the sensor. Very few companies do this type of conversion, charging from 1200 € to &gt; 1500 €, usually only accepting for conversion specific models or brands of cameras. Removing the filters enhances light sensitivity and image effective resolution. A full “full spectrum monochrome” conversion is also possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse colour in UV-A and NIR\n\n\n\nIn a full-spectrum-converted camera the RGB filters on the sensor array remain. These filters also differ in their transmittance for wavelengths in the UV-A and NIR regions, thus, in UV-A and NIR the RGB channels in the sensor respond differently to different wavelengths, even in the absence of red, green and blue light. When the data are “interpreted” by the software (raw converter) as for visible light a false-colour image results. Depending on the case the false colour can be informative or a nuisance. If found a nuisance or confusing the image can be converted from colour into greyscale based on the three channels or by extracting the data for an individual channel.\n\n\nA camera converted to “full-spectrum” is sensitive to an extended range of wavelengths of approximately 340 nm to 1000 nm. This range can be constrained by means of optical filters attached either in front or behind the lens. Thus, a “full-spectrum” converted camera can be used for UV-A, VIS or NIR photography by swapping filters. Having a camera sensitive to a wider range of wavelengths is only one requirement, an objective (= lens) that transmits and performs well in the UV and NIR regions is also needed.",

    "text": "9.2 Objectives\nFor an objective to be suitable for UV or NIR photography it has to have reasonably high transmittance of the wavelengths we intend to capture in the image and it has be corrected for image aberrations and other problems at these same wavelengths. There exist very few camera objectives that can transmit and are corrected for UV, and those that exist are extremely expensive (&gt; 10,000 €) and fragile. I will not discuss such objectives further, instead, I will discuss the cheaper alternative of using normal objectives. Three main difficulties are usually encountered when attempting: low transmittance, ghosting and other reflections, and aberrations than decrease image resolution.\n\nMost photography objectives have high transmittance in the NIR region. Incontrast, most modern, and many vintage, objectives have very low transmittance in the UV region. The reason for this is in the glass used, its thickness, the cemment used to assemble lens groups and the properties of the antireflection coatings used. A general “wisdom” not free of exceptions is that the more elements (more surfaces with coatings) and the thicker these glass elements are, the less likely an objective is to have good UV transmission. This usually means that simpler designs and slower (smaller maximum apperture) objective are more likely to transmit some UV-A radiation. Older or “vintage” objectives had simpler designs and less effective coatings and as a result very few modern objectives have high UV-A transmittance, and the exceptions are a few cheap modern objectives. In general, accidental UV objectives are “prime lenses” (fixed-focal-length objectives) not zooms or extreme wide-angle. It is usual to describe objectives that are not designed for use in UV, but happen to work reasonably well as “accidental” UV-capable objectives.\nTo prevent reflections non-glass surfaces of the “barrel” of the objective and the edges of glass (or plastic) optical elements are painted or treated black. The shape of the surfaces inside the objective in most cases are also designed to reduce reflections. Coatings that have very high absorptance in the VIS region not necessarily have the same property outside the VIS region. One rather extreme case is black-annodized aluminium which is highly reflective in the NIR region. Many photography lenses produce images with hot spots (usually the center of the image) when used in NIR. In most cases this problem is more noticeable at specific appertures. Frequently, ghosting caused by specular reflections is visible in images as bright spots with the shape of the diaphrogm apperture (opening or “hole”). Flare, caused by scattered radiation or diffuse reflection results is a lowering of image contrast. Although there are many more objectives suitable for NIR photography than for UV-A photography, it is important to keep in mind that some objectives produce better images than others.\nChromatic aberrations appear when the path of light of different wavelengths through a lens differs. For example, when a white object is photographed, the red, green and blue components can be slighly displace from each other when projected on the sensor or film. In digital photographs chromatic aberretation are visible in high contrast edges as coloured halos. Most photography objectives are corrected for these aberrations by design only in the VIS range, outside this range how objectives behave is an “accident”. Given the nature of the aberrations the narrower the range of wavelengths captured, the less likely it is they will affect an image.\n\nThe design of any objective is a compromise among multiple criteria, related not only to image quality, but also usability, size, weight and cost of manufacture. The design of different objectives is based on a different compromise. In spite of this, some objectives happen to work reasonably well outside the range of wavelengths for which their design was optimized. They never match the performance of objectives designed for UV photography, which can the used all the way to 250 nm or even shorter wavelengths. However, these extremely expensive and fragile are overkill when the sensitivity of the sensor of a camera is only sensitive to \\lambda &gt; 330\\ldots350 nm.\nFinding a good accidental UV objective is made easier by lists published on the internet. Similar lists exist for objectives that do not free of hot-spot problems. These lists are in many cases bases on tests using different criteria and methods. They serve only as an indication, but provide no guarantee. In addition, many now vintage lenses were manufactured during several decades, with occasional changes in antireflection coatings or other alterations that can affect UV transmittance. There are also a couple of modern objects, manufactured until recently, that do trnsmit UV-A1 and even support autofocus in UV (when there is strong light).\nIn the case of hot spots under NIR, the assessments on which the lists are based are even more subjective as they are usually based on visual assessment of images. In the case of NIR many modern as well as old objectives can be used at least at some appertures. When using vintage objectives on modern cameras one needs to rely on adapter rings, and when using non-macro objectives for macro photography, extenssion tubes are inserted between the objective and the camera. Quite frequenty one can find statements that such tubes without any glass cannot degrade objective performance. This is far from true, and frequently a problem, especially for NIR photography. Many cheap adapters and extenssion tubes are made of aluminium blacked by anodization and are internally highly reflective to NIR radiation and less so to VIS light, but enough to degrade the quality of images not only in NIR. It is common that the inside is ribbed perpendiculalry to the axis of the objective. This helps reduce especular reflections, and when combined with a non-reflecting black paint, very effective. If the ribbed surface is reflective, light is scattered and glare affects the image. These are not the only problems low quality adapters and tubes can introduce. If the dimensions of the mounts and especially the length of adapters is wrong, focusing at infinity can become impossible. This effect is most noticeable with wide angle objectives, e.g., for a fisheye objective with a focal length of 4.5 mm, the required accuracy in the adapter is a small fraction of a millimetre. It is important to be aware of these possible problems. It is also possible to paint the interior wall of extension tubes and adapter oneself if the manufacturer has not done so. The choice of paint is important as only some special paints absorb 95% or more of NIR.",

    "section": "9.3 Optical filters",
    "text": "9.3 Optical filters\nOptical filters select wavelengths through absortion and/or through reflection. Each type has its limitations and benefits, both in performance and cost.\nAbsorptive glass filters are based on “ionic” glass, i.e., glasses including different ions in their composition. Some of the ions tradditionaly used are metals like iron, lead, copper and chrome. As with any material absorbing photons, fluorescence is one of the possible energy dissipation mechanisms. Thus, some of these filters, e.g., when illuminated with UV-A radiation emit fluorescence in the visible range, and other emit NIR fluorescence when illuminated with blue light. The absorptance depends on their thickness as the glass as a whole has uniform properties across its depth. The change in the absorptance spectrum with the angle of light incidence is moderate. Their cut-offs and cut-ins are gradual, and they exist as band-pass, short-pass and long-pass filters. From the perspective of their use, as the transmitted bands are broad, the distinction between short-pass and band-pass gets blured, i.e., most UV-A and UV-B “short-pass” filters do block UV-C and/or shorter wavelengths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilters can deteriorate\n\n\n\nSome types of ionic glass filters have high concentrations of metal salts in their composition and their surface can “corrode” in contact with humid air. If they have antireflection, or other coatings or thin layers deposited on their surface they tend be well protected. Those, with no coatings, can need especially in wet climates to be polished using fime cerium oxide paste or restored chemically. The recommendation is to store filters in a dry place and to regularly inspect the condition of their surface.\nThe spectral transmittance of both clear plastic and glass can change on exposure to strong light, specially blue and shorter wavelengths. In the case of plastics, not only cellulose acetate is affected. Of glasses, those containing iron, usually as an impurity, are the most prone to “yellowing” through “solarization”.\n\n\nPlastic filters are sometimes used, specially at large sizes like 50 \\times 50 mm squares, as they are cheaper. They can be easily damaged in ways that can affect the quality of images, and need to be handled carefully. On the other, small scratches are irrelevant when filters are used on light sources, but it is necessary to protect them from excessive heat.\nUntil approximately 50 years ago gelatine filters were common. Obviously a thin layer of dry coloured gelatine is extremely fragile, but because they are so thin affect an optical system much less than thicker filters. They are still used, especially for filters located between the back of a lens and the sensor or film. When a thicker glass filter is located between sensor or film and objective, the focus point shifts, in extreme cases restricting the focusing range of the objective.\nThere is an additional type of absorptive filters, formely very common in photography: a thin light-absorbing layer of coloured gelatine encased between two layers of optical glass. As far as I know, only Tiffen still makes this type of filter.\nInterference filters work by reflection from surface multilayer thin coatings. As with reflection in general, reflectance by the thin layers is affected by the light incidence angle. In this type of filters the cut-off and cut-in wavelengths shift significantly at shallow light incidence angles compared to normal incidence. Their main advantage is that they can be designed to have very sharp cut-ind and cut-offs, can have multiple discontinuous trtansmission bands and very strong blocking of off-band radiation. They are available with transmitted bands as narrow as a couple of nm to 100’s of nanometres. However´, only the best and most expensive interference filters achieve such high performance. The better filters have more thin-layers with more accurate thickness, which increases the fabrication cost. As they are usually deposited on optical-grade quartz as subtrate, the thikness of the substrate of these filters has little if any affect on their spectral properties. The thin films are fragile, so some of these filters have a hard-coating added at their surface for protection. In spite of working by reflection, which face of the filter points to the light source does not significantly affect their spectral transmittance.\nSome of the best VIS-blocking UV-pass filters for photography and astronomy (“Venus filters”) are interference filters with VIS-absorbing ionic glass as substrate. Some of them, even have different interference filters deposited on each of their faces. Some photographers argue that which face of these filters faces the sensor can affect reflections within the camera resulting slightly different amounts of glare. Of the common filters used in VIS photography, only some UV-blocking and all UV + NIR blocking filters are interference filters, most other filters are absprptive.\nEach glass-air interface reflects approximately 4.5% of the light traversing it as result of the difference in refractive index (n). Modern lenses and good photographic filters are anti-reflection multicoated, and the best ones reflect &lt; 0.1\\% of the light impinging on their surface. These coatings are similar in principle to interference filters, they change n at the surface. However, thet are designed to minimize reflections across a given range of wavelengths instead of increeasing them. In recent year a further additional coating applied to outer lens surfaces and filters, a fluorine compound coating that alters surface properties so that water runs off the surface and dirt does not stick. Antireflection coating do modify the spectral transmittance, increasing it in the target range of wavelengths but frequently decreasing it in other regions of the spectrum.",
