    "text": "6.1 Action and response spectra\nPlants do not respond equally to all wavelengths of , and this spectral response can be described by a response spectrum and/or by an action spectrum. It is important to be aware that an action spectrum is not the same thing as a response spectrum. Although they are both used to describe the wavelength dependency of a biological response to radiation they are measured and used differently. Because they are measured in different ways they yield curves of different shapes. A response spectrum shows the size of the response at a fixed photon fluence1 of radiation across a series of different wavelengths. However, since UV radiation never comes at fixed irradiances over the entire spectrum the response spectrum is of limited use when estimating the physiological response to solar- or broadband UV exposure. In contrast, an action spectrum shows the effectiveness of radiation of different wavelengths in achieving a given size of response. This is a very important difference because dose response curves are not necessarily parallel or linear.\nWhen estimating biologically effective irradiances (see section [sec:BSWFs:UVeff] on page ) it is very important to use appropriate action spectra for each biological process. However, since the action spectra of many biological responses are not known, this provides a dilemma for researchers who must try to chose the action spectrum that best approximates the process they are studying. Using the wrong action spectrum can produce very large errors when predicting effective irradiance and, therefore, UV effects on plants due to e.g. ozone depletion (Rundel 1983; Cullen and Neale 1997). This is also a good reason for continued efforts to measure action spectra.\nBuilding a response spectrum is fairly simple; we need to measure a plant response at a single (photon) irradiance (or fluence) for each wavelength (or narrow band), whereas for constructing an action spectrum ones needs to measure the response at several different photon fluence values for each wavelength of interest.",

    "text": "6.1.1 Constructing a monochromatic action spectrum\nAction spectra are most frequently measured using monochromatic light, i.e. radiation of a single or narrow range of wavelengths. This can be achieved by the use of systems which transmit, or emit, only a defined and usually narrow range of wavelengths, e.g. band-pass filters, LEDs, spectrographs, or lasers (see Chapter [chap:manipulating] for details about radiation sources). It is also possible to build, for example, an UV action spectrum with background irradiation of other wavelengths such us PAR.\nShropshire (1972) describes in detail the theory behind monochromatic action spectra, and the assumptions needed for an action spectrum to match the absorption spectrum of a photoreceptor pigment. He also considers the problem of how screening by other or the same pigments can distort the shape of action spectra. He gives examples for visible radiation but the theoretical considerations are fully applicable to ultraviolet radiation.\nTo construct a true action spectrum we first need to measure dose response curves for radiation of different wavelengths (Figure [fig:construct:action:spectrum]). The more curves we measure and the narrower the wavelength range used for each of these, the more spectral detail will be visible in the action spectrum built from them. For each of these curves, we should use a range of photon fluences yielding response sizes going from relatively small responses to close to the maximum response size (close to saturation). The photon fluence values used should increase exponentially. Photon fluence can be varied both by varying irradiance and/or irradiation times. If irradiation time is varied, it should be checked that reciprocity holds2. We fit a curve to each set of dose response data, using the logarithm of the photon fluence as an independent variable. Using a logarithmic scale is expected to yield a more linear response curve than untransformed photon fluence values. From the fitted dose-response curves we calculate by interpolation the photon fluence required at each measured wavelength to obtain a response of the selected target response size. We use the photon fluence values to calculate effectiveness as \\(1/ (\\pfd \\cdot t)\\) where fluence is given by the product of photon irradiance () by the irradiation time (\\(t\\)), and we finally plot these effectiveness values against wavelength (\\(\\lambda\\)). If the dose response curves are not parallel, the shape of the action spectrum will depend on the target response level chosen. Different causes have been suggested for the lack of parallelism of dose response curves that is sometimes observed. Two of these suggestions are self-screening effects and involvement of two or more interacting pigments in the response (Shropshire 1972). One can in principle use either quantum (=photon) or energy units, but quantum units are preferable as for any photochemical reaction absorption events always involve quanta. The shape of the spectrum will depend on whether an energy or photon basis is used.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nAs the main feature of interest is the shape of the curve, UV action spectra are usually normalized to an action that is equal to one at 300 nm. This is achieved, by dividing all the quantum (or photon) effectiveness values measured at different wavelengths, by the effectiveness at 300 nm. The use of \\(\\lambda =300\\) nm is an arbitrary convention, of rather recent adoption, so you will find, especially in the older literature, other wavelengths used for the normalization.\nA response spectrum will rarely match the absorption spectrum of the photoreceptor because of non-linearities in later steps between light absorption by the photoreceptor and an observed response. In the case of action spectra, by keeping the size of the response constant across wavelengths we attempt to minimize the effect of these non-linearities on the measured spectrum. Because of this, a properly measured action spectrum will usually closely follow the absorption spectrum of the pigment acting as photoreceptor, except from possible effect from interfering pigments. Figure [fig:action:spectra] and Table [tab:action:spectra] show several action spectra relevant to research on the effects of UV on plants. See the article by Gorton (2010) for a deeper discussion on biological action spectra.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Constructing a polychromatic action spectrum\nMonochromatic action spectra are useful to understand the nature of a specific response, e.g. damage, but are not suitable for calculating real effects under solar radiation. The response of a plant to light and UV radiation depends on both the amount of energy (dose-response) and the spectral composition of the radiation. Polychromatic action spectroscopy is based on a background of broad-band white light from artificial sources or natural daylight supplemented by various wavelength, for example between 280 and 360 nm (Holmes 1997). This polychromatic approach provides an action spectrum useful for assessing effects of UV under normal plant growing conditions, because the simultaneous exposure to a broad wavelength interval has a different net effect than that of an exposure to separate monochromatic radiation, due to synergisms or antagonisms between complex chemical and biological processes, for example repair mechanisms (Coohill 1992; Madronich 1993). In practice, such a realistic polychromatic radiation spectrum is achieved using a series of cut-off filters, which cut off radiation of wavelengths shorter or longer than a certain wavelength. The effect of such filters can be compared to the effect of the variable thickness of the stratospheric ozone layer. Figure [fig:Poly:Spectra] shows examples of spectral irradiance for broad band light from lamps filtered by different cut-off filters. The cut-off wavelength usually refers to the wavelength of 50% transmission.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nThe original approach, so called differential polychromatic action spectroscopy, is described by Rundel (1983). Different biological responses are proportional to different specific treatments, for example exposures. Thus, an action spectrum can be estimated by quantifying differences in responses between successive treatments. The number of treatments required depends on the relative change in response over a wavelength interval. One example of a quantifiable effect would be change in the observed concentrations of flavonols.\n\n6.1.2.1 The mathematics behind polychromatic action spectra\nThe average proportionality \\(\\overline{s}\\) between differences in the biological effective response of successive treatments \\(i\\), \\(\\Delta W_{be,i}\\), and differences in exposure (fluence rate multiplied by exposure time), \\(\\Delta\\exposure[i]\\) is given by an average quantity \\[\\overline{s_i} = \\frac{\\Delta W_{be,i}}{\\Delta\\exposure[i]}\\] All the values of \\(\\overline{s_i}\\) together are represented in the action spectrum. If the wavebands of each treatment are small enough, an action spectrum \\(s(\\lambda)\\) can be expressed by a mathematical function. Different functions are discussed (Rundel 1983; Cullen and Neale 1997). In the simplest case the factors \\(\\overline{s_i}\\) are positive and decrease exponentially with increasing wavelength. Thus, one common form of \\(s(\\lambda)\\) is \\[s(\\lambda) = \\mathrm{e}^{-k(\\lambda-\\lambda_0)} \\label{Equ:BSWF:exp}\\] where \\(k\\) is a parameter, which has to be obtained for each different biological effect using a fitting procedure, and a wavelength \\(\\lambda_0\\), where the action spectra are normalised to unity, e.g. \\(\\lambda_0=300\\) nm. Other functions including a polynomial dependence on \\(\\lambda\\) are also possible and perhaps necessary for describing complex mechanisms.\nFor the interpretation of the experimental data, the biological effective response \\(W_{be}\\), it is necessary to consider the wavelength dependency. Thus, it is crucial that the entire spectral irradiance \\(\\irr(\\lambda,t)\\) during the experiment is known. Broad-band meters are not suitable in most cases. This dependency is included in the biological effective dose function (exposure) \\(\\exposure[be]\\), given by\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\exposure[be] & = & \\int_\\lambda \\int_t \\enspace s(\\lambda) \\cdot \\irr(\\lambda,t) \\enspace{\\rm d}t\\enspace{\\rm d}\\lambda \\nonumber \\\\\\nopagebreak\n& = & \\int_\\lambda \\enspace s(\\lambda) \\cdot \\exposure(\\lambda) \\enspace{\\rm d}\\lambda \\label{Equ:Dose:be}\n\\end{aligned}\\] A mathematical model can separate wavelength and dose dependency for a set of experimental data by the use of mathematical functions describing \\(W_{be}(\\exposure[be])\\) and optimisation procedures, e.g. non-linear curve fitting (Cullen and Neale 1997; Ghetti et al. 1999; Ibdah et al. 2002; Götz et al. 2010). The model assumes that photons at different wavelengths act independently, but with different quantum efficiency at the same absorption site, and therefore with the same mechanism. Regarding the shape and saturation of the observed effect, different functions can describe the data of \\(W_{be}(H_{be})\\), for example a linear, hyperbolic or sigmoid function. A simple linear relation is \\[W_{be}(\\exposure[be]) = W_0 \\cdot \\exposure[be] \\label{Equ:Response:lin}\\] with the parameter \\(W_0\\), which has to be determined by the fitting procedure. If for example the exposure time of the radiation is constant and, therefore, not depending on the duration of the experiment \\(t\\), the combination of Eqs. [Equ:BSWF:exp] to [Equ:Response:lin] yields \\[W_{be}(\\exposure[be]) = W_0 \\cdot t \\cdot \\int_\\lambda \\enspace \\mathrm{e}^{-k(\\lambda-\\lambda_0)} \\cdot \\irr(\\lambda) \\enspace{\\rm d}\\lambda \\label{Equ:Response:lin2}\\] To solve the equation for the unknown parameters \\(W_0\\) and \\(k\\), measurements of the biological response \\(W_{be}\\) and the spectral irradiance \\(\\irr(\\lambda,t)\\) have to be put into a fitting routine, to optimise \\(W_0\\) and \\(k\\) by minimising the differences, e.g. the (root) mean square, between measured and modelled values of \\(W_{be}\\). In Figure [fig:Poly:Spectra] are six different scenarios shown. In this case, the differences among six individual measured and modelled responses have to be calculated and the sum of these needs to be minimised by a non-linear optimisation technique, such as that provided by the add-in “Solver” in Excel.\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Action spectra in the field\nUnder field conditions it is more difficult to build UV action spectra, and most frequently what are measured are polychromatic action spectra (e.g. Keiller, Mackerness, and Holmes 2003; Cooley et al. 2000).\nAs many whole-plant responses result from a long signal transduction chain, which depends on the action of more than one photoreceptor, the action spectrum for many responses at the whole-plant or organ level, seems to vary among species, with the seasons of the year or growing conditions. For responses like these it is almost impossible to define a unique and stable action spectrum for plants growing outdoors, as these responses are too far decoupled from the photoreceptors.\nEven if they do not faithfully reflect the properties of a single photoreceptor, action spectra can be extremely useful, as we need them as BSWFs (BSWFs) when calculating biologically effective UV doses (see section [sec:BSWFs:UVeff] on page ), since the same UV radiation spectrum has a different effect on different plant responses (Figure [fig:action:spectra]).",

    "section": "6.3 Appendix: Calculation of polychromatic action spectra with Excel (using add-in “Solver”)",
    "text": "6.3 Appendix: Calculation of polychromatic action spectra with Excel (using add-in “Solver”)\nThis is an example of one possibility to derive the parameters of a polychromatic action spectrum by non-linear optimisation as explained in section 1.8.2 on page . The Excel add-in “Solver” is listed in the menu “Tools”. If this is not the case, it has to be installed in Tools&gt;Add-Ins. This experiment was performed in the small sun simulator of the Helmholtz Zentrum München, Neuherberg, Germany (see section [sec:simulators] at page ) in a special cuvette, which allows simultaneous exposure of plants under different radiation (Ibdah et al. 2002; Götz et al. 2010). Figure [fig:Sosi:Cuvette] shows the cuvette placed in the sun simulator with five rows of glass filters from Schott, Mainz, Germany (WG295, WG305, WG320, WG335, WG360).\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nAt the beginning we have to put all our measured data into different sheets in Excel. In this example, the biological response \\(W_{be}\\) is the -induced flavonoid lutonarin (in \\(\\mymu\\)mol g\\(^{-1}\\) FW (fresh weight)) of the first leaf of the barley cultivar “Barke”. The amount was estimated by HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography). Three young plants in each of three independent experiments were harvested under six different scenarios, which spectral irradiances are shown in figure [fig:Poly:Spectra] in section 1.8.2 on page . The data are put into the first sheet “leaf data” and mean values and standard deviations for each scenario were calculated as illustrated in figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet1]).\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nThe second sheet “spectra” contains all measured spectra of the six different scenarios under the glass filters. For the calculation of a polychromatic action spectrum in the range it is recommended that the spectrum is measured using a double-monochromator system from 280 to 400 nm in steps of 1 nm. In this experiment, the irradiance was increased from the morning until noon and then decreased until the evening, to simulate natural variation in solar radiation. This was done in four steps as shown in the picture of the third sheet “daily exposure” in figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet3]. As an example, typical radiation data under the glass filter WG305, measured during the experiment, are presented in table [tab:App:Poly:Spectra:UV-PAR]. This sheet is only necessary to calculate the exposure time at each light level in seconds as shown in the marked cell F8. Sheet “spectra” contains the wavelengths in column A and all the 24 spectra (six scenarios and four light levels) from column B to Y.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLight level\n1\n2\n3\n4\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n\n0.152\n0.584\n1.135\n1.531\nW m\\(^{-2}\\)\n\n\n\n8.76\n19.78\n24.67\n38.74\nW m\\(^{-2}\\)\n\n\n\n114\n228\n256\n363\nW m\\(^{-2}\\)\n\n\nor\n537\n1073\n1198\n1692\n\\(\\mymu\\)mol m\\(^{-2}\\) s\\(^{-1}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nNow all sheets for input data are finished and the sheets for solving our system of equations has to be prepared. Therefore, the next sheet “weighted spectra” is filled with the information about the action spectrum function as shown in figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet4]. This sheet contains the calculation of the biological effective dose function \\(H_{be}\\) as presented in equation [Equ:Dose:be] on page . First, for the action spectrum \\(s(\\lambda)\\) an exponential function in chosen, as explained for equation [Equ:BSWF:exp] on page . Column A includes the wavelengths and column B the estimated value of the action spectrum using the parameter \\(\\lambda_0=300\\) nm of cell B4 and \\(k=0.200\\) nm\\(^{-1}\\) of cell B5 (marked red in figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet4]). This cell is only a link to cell B11 in the next sheet “SOLVER”. Because it is only the starting value of the optimisation procedure, the values of column B do not represent the real action spectrum. These values will change during optimisation. Below row 6, column D and the following columns (in this case to column AA) include the values of the action spectrum of column B multiplied by the spectral irradiances of each scenario and light levels of sheet “spectra”. Row 1 and 2 include the estimation of the doses. The cells in row 2 from column D and the following columns represent the integration over the wavelengths from 280 to 400 nm of each column beneath multiplied by the exposure time of the respective scenario and light level as previously calculated in the sheet “daily exposure”. Integration in Excel is done by adding the values of the cells regarding the wavelength step as shown for the marked cell D2 in figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet4]. Here it is 1 nm. To get doses in units of Ws m\\(^{-2}\\) (J m\\(^{-2}\\)), the sum is divided by a factor of 1000 because the spectral irradiances were measured in mW m\\(^{-2}\\) nm\\(^{-1}\\). The daily dose (in kJ m\\(^{-2}\\)) is then calculated in row 1 for each scenario by adding the four values of the light levels. These daily doses are now needed for further calculations in the next sheet “SOLVER”.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nThe sheet “SOLVER” as illustrated in figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solver0] includes the comparison of the measured and modelled data—as table and figure. The first five rows are a short explanation of the entire model. Especially row 5 contains the mathematical function describing the measured biological response \\(W_{be}\\), which was the flavonoid content of lutonarin in the first leaf of barley. Here, a sigmoid function was chosen, given by \\[W_{be} = \\frac{W_0}{1+\\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{\\exposure[be]-\\exposure[0]}{b}}} \\label{Equ:Response:sigmoid}\\] Using this function, the values of each scenario of row 15 were calculated. Therefore, the variable coefficients \\(W_0\\), \\(\\exposure[0]\\), \\(b\\), and \\(k\\) as well as their constraints from row 8 to 11 were used. Row 14 includes the mean values of each treatment derived in the first sheet “leaf data”. The squared differences of measured and modelled data are calculated in row 16 and added up in cell C17. All cells are now prepared and we can start to optimise our variable coefficients by minimising the value of cell C17. Thus, we mark this cell by clicking on it and choose from the menu Tools\\(&gt;\\)Solver. A new small window called “Solver Parameters” will appear as shown in the left part of figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solverparam]. Here, the target cell was C17 and the box for minimisation was checked. The optimisation was done by changing the cells B8 to B11 concerning all constraints listed in the sheet. By clicking on the button “Options”, another window will pop up, where the parameters for the optimisation algorithm are defined (right part of figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solverparam]). In this example, a non-linear Newton method was used. The parameters of the upper left part of the window define the number of iterations or the maximum time for calculation as well as the precision or tolerance of the result. After inserting the numbers and checking the necessary boxes, click “OK” to return to the window “Solver Parameters”. Here, the optimisation starts by clicking on “Solve”. After a while, the program returns a message if the search succeeded and by accepting, the result is written into the cells of sheet “SOLVER” chosen for changing.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nThe final result for the data in this example is shown in figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solved]. The sum of the squared differences was minimised to 0.13. The left graph in the bottom of figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solved] shows two bars for each scenario, one for the measured leaf data of row 14 (yellow) and the other one for the modelled data of row 15 (purple). The result looks promising. The most important parameter regarding the action spectrum is \\(k=0.126\\) nm\\(^{-1}\\) in cell B11. This value was used to plot the actual action spectrum of this study in the upper right graph of figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solved]. Our action spectrum is valid for wavelengths between 280 and 400 nm, that interval which was chosen for integration in sheet “weighted spectra”.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nThis example describes just one possibility to solve a multi-variable and non-linear problem. For example, there is also a plugin available for Calc in OpenOffice.org. Therefore, if using Calc instead of Excel, the file NLPSolver.oxt3 has to be installed by the extension manager. Other search algorithms are used in this tool, but the result will be the same.\n\n\n\n\nBjörn, Lars Olof, ed. 2007. Photobiology: The Science of Life and Light. 2nd ed. Springer.\n\n\nCoohill, T.

However, if the irradiation time is varied it is important to check that reciprocity holds. In other words, that the same fluence achieved through different irradiation times elicits the same size of response.↩︎\nReciprocity refers to the assumption that equal values of photon fluence achieved by irradiation differing in length and photon irradiance, but supplying the same total number of photons, are expected to elicit an identical response.↩︎\navailable from http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/project/NLPSolver.↩︎",

    "text": "1.1 Research on plant responses to ultraviolet radiation (2012)\nPlants are exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation in their natural habitats. The amount and quality of radiation they are exposed to depends on the time of the year, the latitude, the elevation, position in the canopy, clouds and aerosols, and for aquatic plants the depth, solutes and particles contained in the water [see #sec-solar-radiation and #sec-UV-aquatic]. Ultraviolet radiation is consequently a carrier of information about the environment of plants. However, when exposed to enhanced doses of radiation or radiation of short wavelengths, plants can be damaged. When exposed to small doses of radiation plants respond by a mechanism involving the perception of the radiation through a photoreceptor called UVR8 (Jenkins 2009; Rizzini et al. 2011; M. Wu et al. 2011; John M. Christie et al. 2012; D. Wu et al. 2012; Heijde and Ulm 2012). This protein behaves as a pigment at the top of a transduction chain that regulates gene expression. Several genes have been identified as regulated by radiation perceived through UVR8. Some are related to the metabolism of phenolic compounds and are involved in the accumulation of these metabolites.[^1] However, these are not the only genes regulated by UVR8. Genes related to hormone metabolism are also affected, and this could be one of the mechanisms for photomorphogenesis by radiation, for example an increase in leaf thickness or reduction in height of plants. Morphological effects of mediated by UVR8 have been described (Wargent et al. 2009).\nThe irradiance of in sunlight is larger than the irradiance of and plants also have photoreceptors that absorb both radiation and blue light. The best studied of these photoreceptors are cryptochromes and phototropins. Cryptochromes are involved in many photomorphogenic responses, including the accumulation of pigments. Phototropins are well known for their role in plant movements such as stomatal opening in blue light and the movement of chloroplasts (see John M. Christie 2007; Shimazaki et al. 2007; Möglich et al. 2010 for recent reviews).\nThe balance between the different wavebands, , and (photosynthetically active radiation, 400–700 nm), has a big influence on the effect of radiation on plants. Unrealistically low levels of radiation and enhance the effects of (e.g. Caldwell, Flint, and Searles 1994). One reason for this is that radiation is required for photoreactivation, the repair of DNA damage in the light.\nFrom the 1970’s until the 1990’s the main interest in research on the effects of on plants and other organisms was generated by the increase in ambient exposure caused by ozone depletion in the stratosphere (e.g., Caldwell 1971; Caldwell, Teramura, and Tevini 1989; Tevini 1993; Caldwell and Flint 1994). This led to many studies on the effects of increased radiation, both outdoors, in greenhouses and in controlled environments. Frequently the results obtained in outdoor experiments differed from those obtained indoors. This lead to the realization that it is important to use realistic experimental conditions with respect to radiation and its ratio compared to other bands of the solar spectrum. Interactions of responses to radiation with other environmental factors like availability of mineral nutrients, water and temperature, were also uncovered. Effects on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems of ozone depletion, and the concomitant increase in radiation, have been periodically reviewed in UNEP (2011, and earlier reports). These reports include chapters on terrestrial ecosystems (Ballaré et al. 2011) and aquatic ecosystems (Häder et al. 2011).\nFrom the 1990’s onwards, the interest in the study of the effects of normal (i.e., without stratospheric ozone depletion), as opposed to enhanced radiation increased markedly (e.g., N. Paul 2001; P. J. Aphalo 2003; Jansen and Bornman 2012). This was in part due to the realization that even low exposures elicit plant responses, and that these are important for the acclimation of plants to their normal growth environment. Furthermore, as these effects were characterized, interest developed in their possible applications in agriculture and especially horticulture (e.g., N. D. Paul et al. 2005).\nA further subject of current interest is the enhanced release of greenhouse gases from green and dead biomass caused by action of radiation on pectins (e.g., Messenger, McLeod, and Fry 2009; Bloom et al. 2010). Another long-standing subject of research are the direct and indirect effects of solar radiation on litter decomposition (e.g., Newsham et al. 1997, 2001; Austin and Ballaré 2010).\nTo be able to obtain reliable results from experiments on the effects of radiation on plants, there are many different problems that need to be addressed. This requires background knowledge of both photobiology, radiation physics, and climatology.",

    "text": "1.2 Progress in research and new perspective (2024)\nNowadays, more emphasis is put on the role of UV radiation as a regulator of plants’ structure and function than as a cause of damage in plants. However, which effect predominates is dose, timing and genotype dependent. Our perspective has changed also in several respects as summarised below. In addition to the role of blue light in the photorepair of DNA damage mentioned above, blue light is now known to play additional roles in UV tolerance through the activation of photoreceptors (Figure 1.1). More broadly, radiation of different wavelengths activates photoreceptors and drives photochemical reactions including photosynthesis, generation of reactive oxygen species and damage to DNA and other molecules (Figure 1.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Range of wavelengths sensed through different higher-plant photoreceptor families or able to drive photoreactions. DNA damage and repair, photosynthesis and photoreceptors; CRY: criptochromes 1 and 2, PHOT: phototropins 1 and 2, ZTL: Zeitloupe, UVR8: “UV-B” photoreceptor, PHY: phytochromes A/B/C/D/E. A dark wide bar indicates wavelengths of high and well demonstrated activity and narrower lighter coloured bars wavelengths for which activity is less important or uncertain. The vertical dashed line indicates the shortest wavelength in sunlight at ground level. An important source of ROS is leakage from electron transport in the light reactions of photosynthesis, thus sharing the wavelengths. However, formation of ROS is not limited to these wavelengths.\n\n\n\n\n\nMolecular studies have revealed a very complex signalling network downstream of plant photoreceptors, that creates crosstalk leading to complex interactions among the responses to different wavelengths. Individual photoreceptors can have multiple modes of action (J. J. Casal, Sánchez, and Botto 1998; Podolec, Demarsy, and Ulm 2021) and the activity of one photorepector may down regulate, up regulate or inhibit the perception of cues by a different photoreceptor (Jorge J. Casal 2009; Zhao et al. 2023). UVR8 and cryptochrome photoreceptors reciprocally modulate their activity at the signalling level through COP1 and BES mediated interactions (Rai et al. 2019, 2020; Tissot and Ulm 2020; Podolec, Demarsy, and Ulm 2021).\nA diagram of signalling downstream of photoreceptors emphasizing crosstalk.\nTime and timing plays a more important role in responses to UV radiation than what was thought 12 years. Responses to UV-B radiation depend on the current and past spectrum and irradiance of UV, visible and near infrared radiation that plants are exposed to (Yan et al. 2020; Rai, Morales, and Aphalo 2021). Further downstream, HY5 and PIFs mediated signalling depends on these two photoreceptors but also on the phytochromes (Sellaro202x?) and phototropins (Vandenbussche et al. 2014). A recent proposal is that the multiple roles played by photoreceptors sharing signalling network components are made possible by compartimentalization into distinct tissues and cell-types (Depaepe, Vanhaelewyn, and Van Der Straeten 2023).\nThe photoreceptors UVR8, CRYs and PHYs, jointly control responses affecting optical properties and display of leaves, that could modify the sensitivity to UV radiation by attenuating it or reducing its interception (Rai, Morales, and Aphalo 2021). The optical properties of the epidermis vary during the course of the day and in response to exposure to blue light and UV radiation (Barnes et al. 2015) and also seasonally (Solanki et al. 2019). Even changes in optical properties of single stranded DNA in chloroplasts can affect sensitivity to damage by UV-B exposure (Saeid Nia et al. 2023). Thus, current understanding of plant responses to UV, VIS and NIR radiation indicates that a broader perspective is needed in the study of plants’ responses sunlight and shadelight at multiple time scales (Barnes 2017; Barnes et al. 2018; Robson et al. 2019).\nIn sunlight, because of the shape of the solar spectrum, UVR8 “the UV-B photoreceptor” mediates responses to both UV-B and UV-A2 radiation, while CRYs are more responsive to solar blue light than to UV-A1 radiation (Rai, Morales, and Aphalo 2021). That responses to UV-A1 and UV-A2 radiation are mediated by different photoreceptors and very distinct, introduces the need to differentiate between UV-A1 and UV-A2 in controlled environments (Rai, Morales, and Aphalo 2021). In the case of some responses UVR8- and CRY-dependent responses complement each other, and a strong phenotype is observed only when both photoreceptors are inactive (Rai et al. 2020; Tissot and Ulm 2020).\nBoth selection and acclimation are crucial to fitness of wild plants and yield of crops (Pedro J. Aphalo and Sadras 2022). Acclimation implies that the previously experienced environment affects later responses, and this is not constrained to the same cue or variable, as environmental correlations in the natural environment are exploited by plants and other organisms as sources of information (Pedro J. Aphalo and Sadras 2022). Thus, time is important with respect to the developmental stage and previous “experience” (a life-time memory) (Rai et al. 2019) and, in some cases at least, previous generations’ “experience” (maternal effects) (Yan et al. 2020).\nAcclimation of stomatal responses in response to exposure to UV radiation (Ač et al. 2024) and of photosynthesis to high versus low light levels (Brelsford et al. 2018), can be relevant to drought tolerance (Jansen et al. 2021; Pedro J. Aphalo and Sadras 2022) and also involves the participation of photoreceptors, sensing UV radiation. In the case of stomata, acclimation can involve changes in opening speed as well as in relative sensitivity to radiation of different wavelengths (Aasamaa and Aphalo 2017).\nMention ABA as a possible link between drought tolerance and UV exposure.\nThe importance of photoperiodism in some plants’ responses has been recognised for a long time. However, recent progress has shown that not only photoperiodic, stomatal and photosynthesis responses but also photomorphogenic responses depend on the time of day (Sellaro202x?). The daily time course of UVR8 dimerization state (Liao et al. 2020) and the seasonality of responses mediated by UVR8 are also two important aspects of timing (Coffey and Jansen 2018).\nTemporal (from seasonal to milliseconds) and spatial heterogeinity in the light environment of plants are an ever present feature outdoors (Hartikainen et al. 2020; Kotilainen et al. 2020; Durand and Robson 2023). Furthermore, even if in its infancy, the study of responses to pulsed light has shown that photoreceptor-dependent responses are not proportional to the average light conditions during the photoperiod, but instead, temporal integration of cues is far more complex and can involve multiple photoreceptors, including UVR8, and PHYs (Sellaro202x?).\nSomething about applications in horticulture could be added here.\nTo study plant responses to UV radiation, consideration of the whole daylight spectrum as well as of the life history of the plants is necessary. It is also necessary to keep in mind relevance to agriculture (Sadras et al. 2021), biological resilience (Thorogood et al. 2023) and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\nTwelve years ago, had already been recognised that the balance between UV-B radiation and longer wavelengths and the timing of UV-B exposure at noon were needed for relevance of research to plants growing in sunlight. Research in the last 12 years has revealed a very complex molecular signalling mechanism, making it important also for mechanistic studies in controlled environments to be aware of VIS and NIR radiation and the corresponding photoreceptors. This is reflected in that several currently active research groups have already bridged the artificial divide between UV plant photobiology and the rest of plant photobiology.",

    "text": "2.1 Introduction\nMost if not all organisms are in a way or another directly dependent on light (L. O. Björn 2015). For humans and most animals, vision is necessary for navigation and communication. Body colour can both enhance visibility and serve as camouflage. For photoautotrophs like plants, light is a source of energy for growth when captured through photosynthesis, but also when sensed through photoreceptors, a source of information. Flower colours and visual patterns are a means of light-mediated communication (Figure 2.1).\nAs a source of energy, short wavelength radiation, if in excess, can damage unprotected tissues through uncontrolled photochemical reactions, i.e., by UV-B exposure breaking bonds in molecules (e.g., Rousseaux et al. 1999). However, these short wavelengths together with longer wavelengths make organisms and objects warmer when they are absorbed. Thus, radiation-driven overheating can also damage tissues and cause the death of organisms, including plants (e.g., xxxxx?).\nDepending on the intensity and timing, radiation of any wavelength from UV-B to thermal infrared can be damaging or beneficial to organisms, including plants. For a given exposure to radiation, the optical properties of vegetation, plants, individual organs such as leaves, tissues, cells and even organelles modulate the fate of the incident energy: radiation that is not absorbed or that is safely dissipated after absorption does not cause damage. White reflective waxes, pubescence, paraheliotropy, and chloroplast accumulation decrease radiation absorption (Figure 2.2), while screening pigments in the epidermis, transpiration, and small-sized leaves contribute to safe dissipation of energy. For radiation that reaches into chloroplasts, biochemical mechanisms for the dissipation have evolved, such as carotenoid cycling.\nSensing of light through photoreceptors as well as its conversion into chemical energy by photosynthesis, start at a photochemical reaction where one (or occasionally two or more) photons transfer energy to a pigment molecule to excite it. Quantum physics helps explain phenomena observable at larger scales, such as action spectra for whole-plant responses.\nIn addition to plant’s optical properties, in photobiology research, optics and radiation physics play a crucial role in the design of experiments and reporting of treatment conditions. For example, when studying photosynthesis using chlorophyll fluorescence, the correct interpretation of the measured yield must be based on the absorbed photons, not the incident ones. Radiation needs to be quantified in a way relevant to the object of study. The optical properties of experimental set-ups, need to be adjusted to the aims of each experiment and, crucially, have to be accurately described. This makes it necessary for those doing research in photobiology to have a good command of how UV, visible and infrared radiation interact with different objects and organisms. The aim of this chapter is to provide such a foundation as support for later chapters in the book.",

    "text": "2.2 Wavelength and Colour\nRadiation, or radiant energy, can be described as waves, with wavelength or frequency as properties, or based on quantum physics, as photons of specific energy. This “double personality” of light is important as each approach provides a simpler explanation than the other one for different specific phenomena, such as refraction and reflection at boundaries between materials and absorption of radiation by pigments and other molecules. From the first perspective, ultraviolet (UV), visible (VIS), and infrared (IR) radiation are electromagnetic waves and are described by the Maxwell’s equations.1 From the second perspective, Plank’s law describes the energy of a quantum as inversely proportional to wavelength.\nThe wavelength ranges of visible radiation, described by their colour based on human vision’s response to monochromatic light, are shown in Figure 2.3, topmost bar of wavebands. The colour ranges indicated in Figure 2.3 are one approximation out of several available. We follow the ISO and CIE standards when applicable. The electromagnetic spectrum is continuous with no clear boundaries between one colour and the next. Colours are the result of the interaction of different wavelengths of radiation with the photoreceptor pigments in the eye and the processing of the stimuli by the brain. Alternative definitions based on other sensory systems or energy capture systems are available, some of them applicable to plants are shown in Figure 2.3, two lowermost bars of wavebands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: The solar spectrum, \\(280-900\\,\\mathrm{nm}\\), and different commonly used named wavebands.

In Figure 2.4 they are shown for a wider range of wavelengths. It is important to keep in mind that the ISO and CIE definitions of the VIS and UV wavebands overlap. Thus, it is incorrect to sum VIS and UV irradiances, while the definitions of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and UV do not overlap. Especially in the IR region, the subdivision is somewhat arbitrary and the boundaries used in the literature vary, with differences even between ISO and CIE standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: The solar spectrum, \\(250-3000\\,\\mathrm{nm}\\), and different commonly used named wavebands.

    "section": "2.3 Angle of Incidence",
    "text": "2.3 Angle of Incidence\nMost frequently we describe the flux of radiation on a plane, usually, but not always a horizontal plane (Figure 2.5). This flux is called irradiance and expressed per unit area and unit time. The area used as a reference is that of the receiving plane. Fluence rate is measured on the surface of a sphere instead of a plane. In this case, the plane is located in three-dimensional (3D) space. When considering a point source of radiation, the angle, \\(\\alpha\\), between the light beam and the receiving plane or surface affects the received irradiance: the shallower the angle of incidence the lower the irradiance from the same beam of light. Both irradiance and fluence rate are fluxes of radiation, expressed per unit area and unit time (Figure 2.5). In the first case the area is that of the illuminated planar surface and in the second case of an spherical surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: The concepts of irradiance and fluence rate explained. (A) A beam of radiation perpendicular to the plane of an irradiance sensor; irradiance and fluence rate have the same numerical value. (B) Radiation beam at an angle to the irradiance sensor; irradiance has a smaller numerical value than fluence rate. (C) Perfectly diffuse radiation from the hemisphere above the irradiance sensor; the numerical value of irradiance is one half that of fluence rate. (D) Perfectly diffuse radiation from both hemispheres, both above and below the sensors; the numerical value of irradiance is one quarter that of fluence rate. A spherical sensor (left) measures fluence rate, and a one-sided planar sensor (right) measures irradiance. In (A) and (B) radiation is collimated and represented by parallel arrows. In (C) and (D) radiation is diffuse and represented by “randomly” oriented arrows. In (A), (B) and (C) the shaded hemisphere of the spherical sensor is grey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSensors and their shape\n\n\n\nThere are, in principle, two possible approaches to measuring radiation. The first is to observe light from one specific direction or viewing angle, which is the radiance \\(L\\). The second is to use a detector, which senses radiation from more than one direction and measures radiation impinging it from all directions from an enclosing sphere or hemisphere. The relation between irradiance \\(E\\) and radiance \\(L\\) at wavelength \\(\\lambda\\) is given by integrating incoming photons over these directions.\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nE[0](\\lambda) & = \\int_\\Omega L(\\lambda,\\Omega) {\\rm d}\\Omega \\label{equ_E0} \\\\\nE(\\lambda) & = \\int_\\Omega I(\\lambda,\\Omega) |\\cos\\alpha| {\\rm d}\\Omega \\label{equ_E}\n%\\end{eqnarray}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nThe shape of a detector entrance-optics, planar or spherical, determines the measured physical quantity, and the weight given to photons from different directions (Figure 2.5). Collection of light on a flat surface (or equivalently through an small opening in an integrating sphere) yields irradiance, energy irradiance, \\(E\\), or photon irradiance, \\(Q\\) depending on the spectral response of the detector. A spherical collecting surface, yields fluence rate (also called scalar irradiance) \\(E_0\\), \\(Q_0\\). In practice, all spherical sensors have a blind stop due to necesary support and connection to a readout device.\n\n\nThe sun, can be assumed to be a point source (the solar disk is \\(\\approx 1 ^\\circ\\) in diameter when seen from Earth). Changes in distance that are of interest when studying plants are extremely small relative to the total Sun to Earth distance and can be ignored. Thus, in the case of direct sunlight, we have to consider only the angle of incidence. For a given light source the maximum irradiance is that received on a plane normal to the light beam (Figure 2.5). As the angle between the beam and the surface becomes shallower, the irradiance measured on the plane decreases, reaching zero, when the beam is parallel to the surface. The relationship between the normal area and that at a shallower angle is given by the cosine of the angle \\(\\alpha\\). When considering the sun, if the receiving plane is horizontal, the angle of interest is the zenith angle (1 - solar elevation angle) (Figure 2.6). If the plane is not horizontal, the angle between the plane and the light beam depends both the the zenith angle and the azimuth angle of the sun’s position, and the effective angle needs to be computed in three dimensions.\n\n\n\nimage/svg+xml\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZenith    Celestial MeridianSunObserverHorizonNAzimuthElevation\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Asimuth and elevation angles of the sun. If the plane on which irradiance is measured is horizontal, the Azimuth angle does not affect the incident angle, and it is enough to only take into account the elevation angle. Modified from figure by TWCarlson - Azimut altitude.svg, CC BY-SA 3.0 file at wikimedia.org.\n\n\n\nObviously, the discussion above ignored scattered radiation from the sky. One approach to the simulation of the light field when multiple sources or sources with a large emitting area are present, is to use ray tracing, which is essentially a divide and conquer approach.\nWhen we considered a point source like a bare LED chip or light from a small light bulb at a relatively short distance from the receiving plane, distance cannot be ignored as done above for the sun, as the illuminated area increases four times for each doubling in the distance. Thus, each doubling in distance decreases irradiance by 75%.\nIn the case of light sources with a large surface relative to the illuminated area or light beams focused by a lens or reflector, the rate of increase in area is smaller than for a point source. The extreme case is a highly collimated laser beam, for which the illuminated area increases very slowly with increasing distance. The irradiance, in these cases, is frequently not uniform within the illuminated area, with in most cases higher iradiance at the centre than at the edges of the illuminated area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nUsing a lens or reflector to make a light beam narrower makes it possible to increase irradiance by concentrating the light energy onto a smaller illuminated area, and this effect can be quantitatively large. Alternatively, the narrower beam makes it possible to move the light source away from the illuminated object maintaining the same irradiance. This can provide additional space for other equipment, or when using selective reflectors that transmit infrared radiation and only reflect VIS and/or UV radiation reduce the heat load on the illuminated object.\n\n\nIn a perfectly collimated beam, the photons follow parallel trajectories. In a beam from a ideal point source the trajectories of the photons are equally probable in all directions (away from the centre of an imaginary sphere). Most real light sources behave somewhere in between these extremes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAngle of Incidence in 3D\n\n\n\nWhile in Figure 2.6, we had the sensor or observer at the centre, and the light source located on an imaginary sphere, here, instead, we locate the point light source at the centre of the sphere. So, when a beam or the radiation passing into a space or sphere is analysed, two important parameters are necessary: the distance to the source and the position of the measurement plane—i.e., if the receiving surface is perpendicular to the beam or at a shallower angle. The geometry is illustrated in Figure 2.7. The radiation is received at distance \\(r\\) by a surface of area d\\(A\\), tilted by an angle \\(\\alpha\\) to the unit sphere’s surface element, a solid angle, d\\(\\Omega\\), which is a two-dimensional angle in a space. The relation between d\\(A\\) and d\\(\\Omega\\) in spherical coordinates is geometrically explained in Figure 2.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Definition of the solid angle dΩ and the geometry of areas in the space (redrawn after Eichler et al. 1993), where the given solid angle dΩ remains the same, regardless of distance r , while the exposed area exemplified by dA will change with distance r from the origin (light source) and the angle α, if the exposed area (or detector) is tilted. The angle denoted by φ is the azimuth angle and θ is the zenith angle.\n\n\n\nThe solid angle is calculated from the zenith angle \\(\\theta\\) and azimuth angle \\(\\phi\\), which denote the direction of the radiation beam\n\\[{\\rm d}\\Omega = {\\rm d}\\theta\\cdot\\sin\\theta{\\rm d}\\phi \\label{equ_dsolidangle}\\] The area of the receiving surface is calculated by a combination of the solid angle of the beam, the distance \\(r\\) from the radiation source and the angle \\(\\alpha\\) of the tilt:\n\\[{\\rm d}A  =  \\frac{r{\\rm d}\\theta}{\\cos\\alpha}\\cdot r\\sin\\theta{\\rm d}\\phi\\] which can be rearranged to\n\\[\\Rightarrow {\\rm d}A  =  \\frac{r^2}{\\cos\\alpha}\\quad{\\rm d}\\Omega\\] Thus, the solid angle is given by\n\\[\\Omega = \\int_A \\frac{{\\rm d}A\\cdot\\cos\\alpha}{r^2} \\label{equ_solidangle}\\] The unit of the solid angle is a steradian (sr). The solid angle of an entire sphere is calculated by integration of the equation above over the zenith (\\(\\theta\\)) and azimuth (\\(\\phi\\)) angles, \\(0\\le\\theta\\le\\pi(180^\\circ)\\) and \\(0\\le\\phi\\le2\\pi(360^\\circ)\\), and is \\(4\\pi\\) sr.\n\n\n\n2.3.1 Radiation Quantities\nThe amount of radiation can be quantified in different ways. Each quantity is useful in different circumstances. We have already used some of these quantities above, here we Quantities can describe flows (energy per unit time), flux rates (energy per unit time and unit area), exposure (energy per event and unit area), radiant flux (energy per unit time) and radiance (energy per unit area and solid angle). The shape of the receiving surface can be a plane, a sphere, a hemisphere or even a cylinder. In the case of radiance, the angle of acceptance of the sensor can also vary but is usually narrow (\\(\\leq 10^\\circ\\)). These definitions are independent of wavelengths, but the quantities are in most cases used to describe energy integrated over a certain range of wavelengths based on the “named” wavebands shown in Figure 2.3 and Figure 2.4. The definitions and symbols of several physical quantities used to describe the “amount of radiation” are given in Table 2.1.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Energy based radiation quantities. Commonly used symbols and units in the SI (Systeme Internationale).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nUnit\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\Phi=\\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial t}\\)\nW = J s\\(^{-1}\\)\nRadiant flux: absorbed or emitted energy per time interval\n\n\n\\(H=\\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial A}\\)\nJ m\\(^{-2}\\)\nExposure: energy towards a surface area.

The irradiance decreases by the square of the distance to the source and depends on the tilt of the detecting surface area, \\(\\alpha\\). This is valid only for theretical point sources, and a good approximation for small ones. For outdoor measurements the sun can be assumed to be a point source. For artificial light sources simple LEDs (light-emitting diodes) without optics on top are also effectively point sources. However, LEDs with optics—and other artificial light sources with optics or reflectors designed to give a narrower light beam—deviate to various extents from the rule of a decrease of irradiance proportional to the square of the distance from the light source.\nWhen we are interested in photochemical reactions, the most relevant radiation quantities are those expressed in photons. The reason for this is that, as discussed in ?sec-radiation-photochemistry-principles, molecules are excited by the absorption of certain fixed amounts of energy or quanta. The surplus energy “decays” by non-photochemical processes. When studying photosynthesis, where many photons of different wavelengths are simultaneously important, we normally use photon irradiance to describe amount of . The name photosynthetic photon flux density, or , is also frequently used when referring to photon irradiance. When dealing with energy balance of an object instead of photochemistry, we use (energy) irradiance. In meteorology both and visible radiation, are quantified using energy-based quantities. When dealing with photochemistry as in responses mediated by UVR8, a photoreceptor, the use of quantum quantities is preferred. Photon based radiation quantities are listed in Table 2.2, the symbol \\(Q\\) (“quanta”) is used for photon irradiance.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.2: Photon-based radiation quantities. Commonly used symbols and units in the SI (Systeme Internationale).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nUnit\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\Phi_\\mathrm{p}\\)\ns\\(^{-1}\\)\nPhoton flux: number of photons per time interval\n\n\n\\(Q=\\frac{\\partial \\Phi_\\mathrm{p}}{\\partial A}\\)\nm\\(^{-2}\\) s\\(^{-1}\\)\nPhoton irradiance: photon flux towards a surface area, photon flux density (earlier frequently called photon flux density and abbreviated as PFD)\n\n\n\\(H_p=\\int_t\\;Q\\;\\mathrm{d}t\\)\nm\\(^{-2}\\)\nPhoton exposure: number of photons towards a surface area during a time interval, photon fluence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese quantities can be also used based on a ‘chemical’ amount of moles by dividing the quantities by Avogadro’s number \\(N_A=6.022\\times 10^{23}\\) mol\\(^{-1}\\). To determine a quantity in terms of photons, an energetic quantity has to be weighted by the number of photons, i.e., divided by the energy of a single photon at each wavelength as defined in equation XXXX. This yields, for example, \\[\\Phi_\\mathrm{p} = \\frac{\\lambda}{h\\;c}\\times\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial t}\\hspace{1cm}\\mathrm{and}\\hspace{1cm}Q(\\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda}{h\\;c}\\times E(\\lambda)\\] When dealing with bands of wavelengths, for example an integrated value like from 400 to 700 nm, it is necessary to repeat these calculations at each wavelength and then integrate over the wavelengths. For example, the photon irradiance or in moles of photons is obtained by \\[Q_\\mathrm{PAR} = \\frac{1}{N_\\mathrm{A}}\\int_{400\\;\\mathrm{nm}}^{700\\,\\mathrm{nm}}\\frac{\\lambda}{hc}\\;E(\\lambda)\\;\\mathrm{d}\\lambda\\] For integrated values of or radiation the calculation is done analogously by integrating from 280 to 315 nm or 315 to 400 nm, respectively.\nIf we have measured (energy) irradiance, and want to convert this value to photon irradiance, the exact conversion will be possible only if we have information about the spectral composition of the measured radiation. Conversion factors at different wavelengths are given below in Table 2.3. For “average daylight” in the wavelength band 400 to 700 nm the conversion factor is approximately \\(4.6\\,\\mathrm{\\mu mol\\,J^{-1}}\\). This is exact at a wavelength at 550 nm, and will deviate depending on the shape of the spectrum.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.3: Energy per photon and conversion factors between photon and energy quantities at different wavelengths.

Although quantitatively irrelevant to systems other that human vision, they are commonly used by lamp manufacturers to describe light output of artificial light sources. Photometric sensors are also the most widely available. Photometric or illumination quantities are expressed in different units than those of physical quantities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotometric quantities\n\n\n\nIn contrast to (spectro-)radiometry, where the energy of any electromagnetic radiation is measured in terms of absolute power (\\(J\\,s^{-1} = W\\)), photometry measures light as perceived by the human eye. Therefore, radiation is weighted by a luminosity function or visual sensitivity function describing the wavelength dependent response of the human eye. Due to the physiology of the eye, having rods and cones as light receptors, different sensitivity functions exist for the day (photopic vision) and night (scotopic vision), \\(V(\\lambda)\\) and \\(V'(\\lambda)\\), respectively (Figure 2.8). The maximum response during the day is at \\(\\lambda=555\\) nm and during night at \\(\\lambda=507\\) nm. Both response functions (normalised to their maximum) are shown in the figure below as established by the Commission Internationale de l’Éclairage (CIE, International Commission on Illumination, Vienna, Austria) in 1924 for photopic vision and 1951 for scotopic vision (Schwiegerling 2004). The data are available from the Colour and Vision Research Laboratory. The photopic response, \\(V(\\lambda)\\), is used as the basis of all photometric measurements. However, for very low irradiance, it is possible to compute similar quantities using the scotopic response \\(V'(\\lambda)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Photopic response of the human eye, \\(V(\\lambda)\\), normalised. This is the 2 degrees curve. The numbers in the colour bar, indicate the relative sensitivity, as a percent, to different colours of light as defined in standard ISO 21348.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: It is important to be aware that these response curves are based on a small number of subjects and, due to variation, not necessarily representative of any individual person, or even of persons of different age or of other ethnicities than those in the study in which the data for the curves were obtained.\nIf we convolute (multiply wavelength by wavelength) the photopic response spectrum with a spectral irradiance we obtain a new curve (Figure 2.9). The area under this curve, multiplies by a constant, is a measure of the perceived brightness of the light by a “typical” human observer, in this case, \\(E_\\mathrm{v} = 103\\,\\mathrm{klx}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: Photopic response of the human eye, \\(V(\\lambda)\\) from Figure 2.8 convoluted by the AM1.5 solar spectrum from Figure 2.3. The area under the curve, is a measure of brightness as perceived by a human. The numbers in the colour bar, indicate the relative contribution, as a percent, of different colours of light as defined in standard ISO 21348.\n\n\n\n\n\nCorresponding to the physical quantities of radiation summarized in Table 2.1 above, the equivalent photometric quantities are listed in the Table 2.4 below and have the subscript \\(\\mathrm{v}\\). The ratio between the (physiological) luminous flux \\(\\Phi_\\mathrm{v}\\) and the (physical) radiant flux \\(\\Phi\\) is the (photopic) photometric equivalent \\(K(\\lambda)=V(\\lambda)\\times K_m\\) with \\(K_m=683\\) lm W\\(^{-1}\\) (lumen per watt) at 555 nm. The dark-adapted sensitivity of the eye (scotopic vision) has its maximum at 507 nm with 1700 lm W\\(^{-1}\\). The base unit of luminous intensity is candela (cd). One candela is defined as the monochromatic intensity at 555 nm with \\(I=\\frac{1}{683}\\) W sr\\(^{-1}\\). The luminous flux of a normal candle is around 12 lm. Assuming a homogeneous emission into all directions, the luminous intensity is about \\(I_v=\\frac{12\\;\\mathrm{lm}}{4\\pi\\;\\mathrm{sr}}\\approx 1\\) cd.\n\n\n\nTable 2.4: Photometric quantities.

PAR is expressed in physical units as a flux of photons of wavelengths between 400 and 700 nm. Before its widespread acceptance and the widespread availability of PAR or “quantum” light sensors, both energy and photometric quantities were frequently used in research on plants and vegetation. Very long term series of global radiation are available, while those for PAR are shorter and fewer.\nIn the case of UV radiation, different biologically effective weightings are used, mostly to describe damage or inhibition. These quantities are normally expressed using energy flux units. However, these are weighted values that do not describe an energy flux but instead a value assumed to be proportional to a response such as growth inhibition (thus based on the same approach as used for photometric quantties).\nPhotosynthetically active radiation, Caldwell’s Generalized Plant Damage spectrum or GPAS-based exposures, and several other “effective” quantities are in common use in plant research and plant production. These are described in detail in Chapter XXXXX.",

    "text": "2.4 Interactions of Light with Matter\n\n2.4.1 Reflection\nCollimated light reflected from a mirror surface remains collimated, while its direction changes. Light reflected from a white surface is scattered, and if previously collimated, after being reflected it becomes more diffuse, i.e., it leaves the surface in multiple directions. A black surface does not reflect the incident light, it absorbs it. A clear or transparent object transmits all the light incident on its surface, similarly to reflection from mirrors and white surfaces, a clear object can scatter the light passing through it or not. Real objects share some of the properties of these theoretical objects. For example, the atmosphere is not perfectly clear and does partly scatter and partly absorb radiation, depending on the wavelength of the incoming or outgoing radiation. The same applies to water. In both cases, interactions take place as the light travels through them, as well as at the interface between media with different refractive index.\nSpecular reflection, like in a mirror, affects the angle of the beam consitently, thus, preserving the image. Diffuse reflection consists in scattered light, thus the image is not preserved, light on a white matte wall (Figure 2.10). The sum of specular and diffuse reflection is called total reflection.\n\\[R^\\mathrm{tot} = R^\\mathrm{spcl} + R^\\mathrm{diff}\\]\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n  \n  \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n  specularreflection\n  diffusereflection\n  incident light\n \n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: Specular and diffuse reflection source temporary fill to be replaced by figure redrawn from Gates, D (1980) Figure 8.35.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGloss\n\n\n\nGloss is assessed as specular reflectance. Depending on the type of surface, different angles of incidence for the collimated light beam are used. “Gloss meters” are frequently used in industrial quality control, but have been occasonally used to characterize the surface optical properties of individual plant leaves (add reference).\n\n\nAt the boundary between two materials with different refractive index, the direction of the light beam changes, and depending on the difference in refractive index and the angle of incidence, a varying fraction of the incident light is reflected at the interface (Figure 2.11). On a flat surface like a glass plate or polished metal surface the applicable equation is that derived from Snell’s law, which mathematically is given by\n\\[n_1 \\times sin(\\theta_1) = n_2 \\times sin(\\theta_2)\\]\nwhere \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) are the refractive indexes of two materials, such as air and glass, and \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) and the refraction angles.\nReflectance can be estimated from the difference in refractive index and the angle of incidende of the light onto the plane of the interface. Reflectance depends on the contribution of \\(s\\) and \\(p\\) polarised components.\n\\[R_p = \\left(\\frac{n^2 \\times \\cos(\\theta) - \\sqrt{n^2 - \\sin(\\theta)^2}}\n{n^2 \\times \\cos(\\theta) +\n        \\sqrt{n^2 - \\sin(\\theta)^2}}\\right)^2\\]\nand\n\\[R_s = \\left(\\frac{\\cos(\\theta) - \\sqrt{n^2 - \\sin(\\theta)^2}}\n{\\cos(\\theta) +\n        \\sqrt{n^2 - \\sin(\\theta)^2}}\\right)^2\\]\nCombining both formulas above, weighted based on the contributions of \\(p\\) and \\(s\\) components. The reflectance of a single interface can be calculated as\n\\[R = R_p \\times f_p + R_s \\times f_s\\]\nwith \\(f_p + f_s = 1\\), for the fraction of the radiation with \\(p\\) and \\(s\\) polarization planes. Using these equations, the reflectance at a glass window in contact with air of both sides can be computed. The refractive index of air is 1 and that of glass 1.5, so reflectance for a relative refractive index of \\(n = 1.5\\) is shown in Figure 2.11 simulates a single and a double interface.\nThe reflectance for two surfaces can be computed taking into account multiple back and forth reflections within the glass pane as well as its internal absorbance, or approximated ignoring them, as in Figure 2.11. For a clear glass pane the error is not too large, but for some other materials could cause significant bias in the estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11: Reflectance of a crown glass or acrylic pane in air as a function of the angle of incidence of light. The dark grey area under the dashed line describes the light reflected by the air to glass (or entrance) interface and the pale grey area describes the light reflected at the glass to air (or exit) interface and the solid line the sum of them. The minimum reflectance at the first interface is 4%. Computed based on a relative refractive index (\\(n\\)) of 1.5, ignoring the higher order reflections of light bouncing back and forth within the glass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractical examples\n\n\n\nThe fraction of the incident light reflected by the glass or plastic roof of a greenhouse depends on the angle of incidence of the light, making the orientation and inclination of the roof play an important role in determining the transmittance of daylight at different times of the day and seasons of the year.\nThe same applies to plastic films and sheets used to filter-out UV radiation in field experiments: the transmittance of the filters will vary reflecting proportionally more PAR and UV radiation when the angle of incidence of sunlight is shallower.\n\n\nThe refractive index, \\(n\\), is dependent on wavelength \\(\\lambda\\). How strong is this dependency, depends on the material. As the refractive index of air is \\(n = 0\\), this simplifies computattions for interfaces involving air. The wavelength dependency of \\(n_\\lambda\\) determines the wavelength dependency of spectral reflectance, \\(R_\\lambda\\), of a non-scattering surface (Figure 2.12).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12: Spectral reflectance of different materials computed from the spectral refractive index \\(n_\\lambda\\) for an angle of incidence of \\(60^\\circ\\) away from the normal. Within each type of material \\(n_\\lambda\\) can vary and a result of oxydation of metal surfaces and additives and surface coatings on glass and plastic sheets.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a rough surface, different points of the receiving surface are at different angles to the light beam, thus the equations above do not apply to the angle between the light beam and the plate as a whole. In addition, inclusions like air bubbles and small particles of a material with a different \\(n\\) than the material matrix create additional interfaces within the plate. In all these cases, different photons are reflected at different angles, scattering the light. These are some of the properties used for making diffusive plates from clear materials. In a perfect diffuser internal absorptance \\(A_i = 0\\), and half of the incoming photons exit from each face of a thin plate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefractive index\n\n\n\nThe refractive index, \\(n\\), is a property of a material, but we must remember that, for example, corrosion of the surface of a metal plate, changes the material at the interface with air into an oxide. Thus, the corresponding value of \\(n\\) also changes. Furthermore, corrosion of a polished metal surface frequently increases roughness, and thus scattering of the reflected light can also increase.\n\n\nWhen the material does not absorb any of the photons travelling through it, i.e., its internal absorptance \\(A_i = 0\\), and consequently, its internal transmittance \\(T_i = 1\\), total transmittance is given by \\(T_t = 1 - R_t\\), where \\(R_t\\) is the total reflectance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\nThe surface of a water body reflects more light when the sun is low in the sky than at noon, at least if the surface of the air-water interface is horizontal and undisturbed by waves. Waves can be expected to increase reflectance when the sun is high in the sky by changing the average angle of incidence away from the normal, but to decrease it when the sun is low in the sky by altering the average angle of incidence in the opposite direction.\nIn the absence of waves, specular reflection predominates, and how the surface looks to us depends on our position relative to the sun and clouds. With waves, how the water surface looks to us will be less dependent on our position and we will no longer recognize the reflection of clouds and the sun (Figure 2.13).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.13: Sunlight reflection from the surface of a water body depends on the angle of incidence of the sun onto the surface. In this example, bright specular reflections towards the camera are seen only for specific angles between the water surface, the sun and the camera.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany materials do absorb photons as they travel through them. The proportion of the photons incident at the surface and not reflected, i.e., entering the medium that remain at different depths in the medium depends on how many are absorbed or have deviated from their original direction of travel. Thus, absorption and scattering within a medium attenuate the light beam as photons travel through the medium, as discussed next.\n\n\n2.4.2 Attenuation\nWe use the term attenuation irrespective of whether the decrease in irradiance and radiance is due to absorption, scattering or reflection. Absorption implies that the energy is transferred to the medium causing the attenuation, while reflection and scattering as discussed above, are due to changes in the angle or direction in which light propagates. Absorption and scattering are “inherent optical processes”, because they depend on the characteristics of the material itself and are independent of the light field. In addition, re-emission of absorbed photons as fluorescence can moderate overall attenuation as well as alter the spectral composition. Bioluminiscence, emission of light by conversion of other forms of energy into light is possible, and can be important in aquatic systems. We next discuss how light interacts with a medium as it travels through it, considering absorption and scattering.\nThe number of photons absorbed, or amount of energy transferred, depends on the distance travelled within the medium, thus a gradient is created along the light path. In the simple case of a light beam normal to the boundaries of a “slice” of a non scattering material, such as a true solution in the cuvette of a spectrophotometer, the length of the path is given by the thickness of the “slice”.\nAt shallower angles of incidence, the effective path becomes longer (Figure 2.14). However, the angle used to compute the length of the path is not the angle of incidence \\(\\alpha\\) because refraction changes this angle into \\(\\beta\\). Specular reflectance takes place symmetrically to the incidence angle, at angle \\(\\alpha^\\prime\\). The value of \\(\\beta\\) is dependent on \\(n\\), the diagram was computed for \\(n = 1.36\\) (Figure 2.14).\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        image/svg+xml\n        \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              n = 1.36\n            \n            \n          \n          \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nFigure 2.14: Refraction alters the angle of the beam, creating reflection but also displaces the transmitted light beam, modifying the path length. From Wiki Commons\n\n\n\nEven if continuous, we can conceptually divide media into layers to describe how light is attenuated as photons travel through them. Here we consider a layer between horizontal planes \\(z_0\\) and \\(z_1\\), within the matrix of the medium (Figure 2.15). Thus, we can ignore refraction and reflectance at material interfaces. The processes responsible for the changes in the radiance \\(L(\\lambda,\\theta,\\phi)\\) as a radiation beam travels through a material, are primarily absorption \\(a\\) and scattering \\(s\\), where \\(\\lambda\\) stands for wavelength, and \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\phi\\) are angles relative to the planes delimiting the slice.\nRadiance is not only attenuated, it can also be added to the directly transmitted beam, coming from different directions, due to elastic scattering, by which a photon changes direction but not wavelength or energy level3. An example of this is Raleigh scattering by very small particles, which causes the scattering of light in a rainbow. A further, wavelength-specific gain of radiance into the direct path is possible through inelastic processes like fluorescence, where a photon is absorbed by the material and reemitted as a photon with a longer wavelength and lower energy level, and through Raman scattering. The elastic and inelastic scattered radiances are denoted as \\(L^E\\) and \\(L^I\\), respectively. Internal sources of radiance, \\(L^S\\), like bioluminescence of biological organisms or cells contribute also to the detected radiance. The path of the light beam through a thin horizontal layer with thickness \\(\\Delta z=z_1-z_0\\) is shown schematically in Figure 2.15.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.15: Path of the radiance and influences of absorbing and scattering particles in a thin homogeneous horizontal layer of air or water. The layer is separated from other layers of different characteristics by boundary lines at height \\(z_0\\) and \\(z_1\\).\n\n\n\nPutting together the different components described above, the radiative transfer equation is obtained \\[\\cos\\theta\\,\\frac{{\\rm d}L}{{\\rm d}z} = -(a+s)\\times L + L^E + L^I + L^S \\label{equ_rte}\\] The dependencies of \\(L\\) on \\(\\lambda\\), \\(\\theta\\), and \\(\\phi\\) are omitted here for brevity. No exact analytical solution to the radiative transfer equation exists, hence it is necessary either to use numerical models or to use analytical approximations.\nThe parameters of the light field can be simulated by modelling the paths of photons, also called “ray tracing”. For an infinite number of photons, the light field parameters reach their exact values asymptotically. The advantage of numerical simulation methods is a relatively simple structure of the program, but its disadvantage is the time-consuming computation involved. Details of the application of the Monte Carlo method to simulations are explained for example by Prahl et al. (1989), Wang, Jacques, and Zheng (1995)4, or Mobley (1994).\nThe other way to solve the radiative transfer equation is through the development of analytical approximations for all the quantities needed. In this case, the result is not exact, but it has the advantage of fast computation and that the analytical equations can be inverted easily. This leads to the idealised case of a source-free (\\(L^S=0\\)) and non-scattering media, i.e., \\(b=0\\) and therefore \\(L^E=L^I=0\\). Then, equation XXXX can be integrated easily to yield\n\\[L(z_1) = L(z_0)\\times \\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{a\\cdot(z_1-z_0)}{\\cos\\theta}}\\]\nThe radiance value at the upper boundary, \\(L(z_0)\\), is presumed known. This equation is known as Beer’s law (or Lambert’s law, Bouguer’s law, Beer-Lambert law), and describes any instance of exponential attenuation of light and is exact only for purely absorbing media—i.e., media that do not scatter radiation. It is of direct application in analytical chemistry, as it describes the direct proportionality of absorbance (\\(A\\)) to the concentration of a “coloured” solute in a transparent solvent. True solutions are optically homogeneous, while suspensions and aerosols are not. The latter scatter light and their behaviour is different from that described by Beer’s law. In chemistry, Beer’s law is formulated in a simplified way by assuming a collimated light beam incident at 90 degrees\n\\[I_\\lambda(z_1) = I_\\lambda(z_0) \\times \\mathrm{e}^{-k_\\lambda\\times c\\times l}\\] where \\(I_\\lambda(z_0)\\) and \\(I_\\lambda(z_1)\\) are irradiances, \\(k_\\lambda\\) is the attenuation coefficient of the solute, \\(c\\) is the concentration of the solute, and \\(l = z_1 - z_0\\) is the path length. As the value of \\(k_\\lambda\\) is a function of wavelength, \\(\\lambda\\), how much \\(I\\) is attenuated also depends on \\(\\lambda\\).\nThis equation can be used to compute irradiance at any point in the path by varying \\(l\\) if \\(k_\\lambda\\) and \\(c\\) are known. In chemical analysis, the equation is used to estimate \\(c\\) with \\(k_\\lambda\\) and \\(l\\) known. For a valid estimate, all the quantities must be expressed in coherent units, and the solvent should not absorb photons in the wavelength range of interest. In practice, in most cases both the pure solvent and the solution are measured, and the effect of the solute obtained by difference. A calibration curve based on a dilution series of known concentrations is safest when the pure solute is available.\nIrradiance in a solution changes with path length following an exponential attenuation curve, i.e., the curve is asymptotic (Figure 2.16).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.16: Hypothetical light attenuation curve computed with the Beer-Lambert equation assuming \\(k \\times c = 5\\). This figure illustrates the shape of the curve, while the \\(z_i - z_0\\) are arbitrary path lengths \\(l\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRadiation transfer models\n\n\n\nRadiation transfer models like TUV and libradtran simulate the modifying effect of the atmosphere on extraterrestrial solar spectral irradiance to estimate the daylight spectrum at ground level or at different elevations within the atmosphere. Importantly, these models compute the effect of the surface albedo, aerosols, clouds and particles in the atmosphere.\nThe output from both models can be either spectral irradiance or spectral radiance. They also estimate the direct and diffuse components, as well as the upwelling scattered radiation from the ground surface.\nBoth libradtran (Emde et al. 2016) and TUV models can be installed and run locally, while a simplified interactive on-line application Quick TUV Calculator is available. R package ‘photobiologyInOut’ can import data generated by these models into R objects. R package ‘forqat’ can do simulation with TUV, either locally installed or using the Quick TUV API, directly from within R.\nRadiation transfer models have also been developed for simulation of the within canopies (e.g., Chelle, Andrieu, and Bouatouch 1998; Chelle et al. 2007) and as well as within leaves, e.g. PROSPECT (Feret et al. 2008; Li et al. 2023).\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Radiation, Atoms and Molecules\nI propose here a new section, that needs to be consistent with what Wolfgang will write about related subjects.\nA pigment is a light absorbing chemical or biochemical molecule. Which wavelengths are absorbed or not is determined by the allowed energy levels and transitions because only photons with “matching” energy can be absorbed. Pigment molecules with enhanced energy states as a result of an interaction with one or more photons are said to be “excited”. The additional energy absorbed from photons can be dissipated through different excitation decay mechanisms. Excitation can also lead to conformational changes in proteins and modify their readiness to interact with other molecules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe principles of photochemistry\n\n\n\nLight is electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths to which the human eye, as well as the photosynthetic apparatus, is sensitive (\\(\\lambda \\approx\\) 400 to 700 nm). However, sometimes the word light is also used to refer to other nearby regions of the spectrum: ultraviolet (shorter wavelengths than visible light) and infra-red (longer wavelengths). Both particle and wave attributes of radiation are needed for a complete description of its behaviour. Light particles or quanta are called photons.\nSensing of visible and radiation by plants and other organisms starts as a photochemical event, and is ruled by the basic principles of photochemistry:\nGrotthuss law: Only radiation that is actually absorbed can produce a chemical change.\nStark-Einstein law: Each absorbed quantum activates only one molecule.\nAs electrons in molecules can have only discrete energy levels, only photons that provide a quantity of energy adequate for an electron to ‘jump’ to another possible energetic state can be absorbed. The consequence of this is that substances have colours, i.e. they absorb photons with only certain energies. See Nobel (2009) and Lars Olof Björn (2007) for detailed descriptions of the interactions between light and matter.\n\n\nIn the case of photoreceptors the operationally relevant mechanism is triggering a cascade of events in a transduction change, most frequently, but not only, resulting in changes in gene expression, protein localization or membrane permeability.\nFluorescence is the “decay” of part of the energy acquired through absorption of radiation, by emission of radiation of longer wavelength (photos of lower energy) (Figure 2.17). This red-shift is caused by action of competing routes for energy dissipation, such as thermal energy loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.17: The Perrin-Jablonski diagram showing energy states. The absorption of a photon is depicted together with the different pathways for energy disipation. Energy increases upwards on the vertical axis. (Modified from diagram by Germain Salvato-Vallverdu.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpectral absorptance\n\n\n\nAbsorptance, \\(\\alpha\\), and absorbance, \\(A\\), are wavelength dependent. We perceive this as colour. The colour of things is ultimately determined by the allowed energy states of molecules “selecting” which photons are absorbed or not, and fluorescence of which wavelength is emitted. This is because, as seen above the energy of a photon corresponds to matching wavelength, and thus, also colour.\nWhen fluorescence occurs as the result of the interaction of a molecule with a single photon, fluorescence is necessarily emitted as photons of at most slightly lower energy than the absorbed ones. There are exceptional cases when the energy gained from more than one photon drives the emission of a single photon of higher energy, and thus shorter wavelength. Obviously the flux of energy emitted as radiation remains less than that absorbed, but shared among fewer photons.\nLarge molecules like photoreceptors contain many electrons and can change in configuration after absorption of a photon. With many allowed energy states they tend to display spectra with multiple broad peaks.\n\n\nFor molecules in an ideal solution their interaction with the medium modifies the allowed energy states and thus, also their absorption spectrum, but, usually, only slightly (Figure 2.18). In this same case, of molecules in solution, it is convenient to express their ability to absorb light per mole. The IUPAC-recommended name for this property is called molecular attenuance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.18: Normalised absorbance spectrum of chlorophyll a in methanol and diethyl ether.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen light drives a photochemical reaction, the quantity quantun yield describes the reaction efficiency as the ratio between the rate at which the product molecules are pruced and the rate at which photons are being absorbed. The units are mol mol\\(^{-1}\\).\nFinally it is possible to combine molecular attenuance and quantun yield to describe the rate of a photochemical reaction relative to incident radiation.\nSome ideas of what could be still\n\nDecay/quenching: thermal, fluorescence, phosphorescence\nLuminescence\nmolar cross section\n\n\n\n2.4.4 Quantities Describing Light-Matter Interactions\nRadiation incident on an object can be partitioned into three components based on its fate,\n\\[1 = R^\\mathrm{tot} + \\alpha + T^\\mathrm{tot}\\] where \\(R^\\mathrm{tot}\\), \\(\\alpha\\), and \\(T^\\mathrm{tot}\\) are expressed as fractions Table 2.5. Alternatively, they can be expressed as percentages.\nIf \\(I_0\\) is the irradiance on the surface of an object, the “irradiance” entering the body of the object is given by \\(I_0 \\times (1 - R^\\mathrm{tot})\\). The irradiance exiting the opposite side of the object is given by \\(I_0 \\times T^\\mathrm{tot}\\).\nInternal transmittance \\(T^\\mathrm{int}\\) considers only the radiation entering the object, thus,\n\\[1 = \\alpha + T^\\mathrm{int}\\] from which it follows that always \\(T^\\mathrm{int} \\geq T^\\mathrm{tot}\\). To convert \\(T^\\mathrm{int}\\) into \\(T^\\mathrm{tot}\\) we need to know \\(R^\\mathrm{tot}\\),\n\\[T^\\mathrm{tot} = T^\\mathrm{int} \\times (1 - R^\\mathrm{tot})\\] and \\[T^\\mathrm{int} = \\frac{T^\\mathrm{tot}}{1 - R^\\mathrm{tot}}\\]\nAbsorbance (\\(A\\)) is a logarithm-transformed quantity. In Chemistry \\(A\\) is most frequently computed using base-10 logarithm, while is some other fiels natural or \\(e\\)-based logarithms are used.\n\\[A = -\\log_{10}(1 - \\alpha) = -\\log_{10}(T^\\mathrm{int}) = -\\log_{10}(R^\\mathrm{tot} + T^\\mathrm{tot})\\]\nWe use \\(A\\) as symbol for decadic absorbance, for which \\(A_{10}\\) may be used in other publications. We use the subscript to indicate the wavelength in nanometres (nm), e.g., \\(A_{663}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nAs discussed earlier in this chapter, in the Beer-Lambert equation solute concentration enters as an exponent, i.e., a power of \\(e\\). Thus, \\(A \\propto c\\), and a convenient quantity for assessing concentrations of a solute as \\(c = A \\times k\\) where \\(k\\) is the slope of an empirical calibration curve.\nIn chemistry and biochemistry when using a spectrophotometer it is the norm to measure a blank as reference. The assumption is that \\(R^\\mathrm{tot}\\) is the same for the blank and the sample, thus the difference between blank and sample, corresponds to absorptance, \\(\\alpha\\), or \\(1 - T^\\mathrm{int}\\). As the solvent is used for the blank, the difference in absorptance can be attributed to the solute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.5: Physical quantities that describe the interaction of objects and light and related quantities describing intensive properties of materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nUnit\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\\(R^\\mathrm{tot}\\)\nfraction\nTotal reflectance:\n\n\n\\(R^\\mathrm{spcl}\\)\nfraction\nSpecular reflectance:\n\n\n\\(R^\\mathrm{diff}\\)\nfraction\nDiffuse reflectance:\n\n\n\\(n\\)\nnumeric\nRefractive index:\n\n\n\\(T^\\mathrm{tot}\\)\nfraction\nTotal transmittance:\n\n\n\\(T^\\mathrm{int}\\)\nfraction\nInternal transmittance:\n\n\n\\(\\alpha\\)\nfraction\nAbsorptance:\n\n\n\\(A\\)\na.u.\nAbsorbance:",

    "section": "",
    "text": "4.1.1 Introduction to UV, VIS and NIR radiation\nIn this section we will discuss the quantities, units and terminology used to describe visible and UV radiation, and explain how to use and interpret information about radiation. We will explain the basic concepts associated with quantifying radiation and how the different aspects of this topic are applied to UV experimentation.\nWhen describing experimental conditions we need to avoid all ambiguity, so that our results can be interpreted and experiments repeated. For this reason “Light intensity” and “amount of light”, which are ambiguous terms, should be avoided in scientific contexts unless it is made absolutely clear what they stand for.\nRadiation always consists of different wavelength components, although we often use the term “monochromatic” when the spectral range is narrow. Not even a single photon can be assigned an exact wavelength. As radiation also travels in various directions, it is also always associated with a distribution of directions. When we say “collimated radiation”, we mean that the angular distribution is very narrow. When we say “diffuse:rad”, we mean that the angular distribution is wide. In order to fully describe radiation, we must therefore describe the distribution of its wavelength components (the spectral distribution) and their direction in addition to “amount”. Polarization is another property of radiation, but it will not be dealt with here. Finally, we should consider the time dimension; radiation changes over time. Radiation can be measured almost instantaneously and expressed as a rate, or integrated over time. Consequently we must distinguish between total energy, or the total number (or total number of moles) of photons, and the energy-or-photons per unit time. The first case gives an accumulated quantity, and the second case gives a rate. A clear distinction should also be made between the incident radiation on a target and the amount of radiation absorbed. When dealing with ionizing radiation, the term “dose” is always used to mean the radiation absorbed, however the same term often designates incident radiation when used in connection with ultraviolet-B and visible radiation.\nA comprehensive glossary of terms relating to visible and ultraviolet radiation has been published by Braslavsky (2007). It can be downloaded from the Internet (see link in reference list).\n\n\n4.1.2 Direction\nDaylight radiation has two components: (a) radiation arriving directly from the sun, or direct:rad, and (b) radiation arriving from the sky, or diffuse:rad. Because it is very distant compared to its size, the sun behaves almost as a point source. For this reason direct radiation at the Earth surface comes from a single direction, so that its ‘rays’ are parallel or collimated. Diffuse radiation is due to scattering and reflection in the atmosphere, and arrives from the whole sky, its ‘rays’ are not parallel. Diffuse radiation is not collimated.\nLight meters and radiation sensors are usually calibrated using radiation from (approximately) a single direction, i.e., collimated radiation from a lamp, but in nature (where most plants live!) radiation is not collimated. The solar radiation reaching the ground on clear cloud-free days as direct sunlight is rather well collimated, but in addition to direct radiation there is diffuse radiation from the sky. Furthermore, radiation reflected by the ground and objects in the surroundings also contributes to the diffuse radiation received by plants. A plant scientist wishing to understand how plants use and react to radiation has to take both direct and diffuse radiation into account.\nMany radiation meters have a flat receiving surface, just like many plant leaves, and so should in principle be well suited to measuring the radiation reaching a leaf. But if we are interested in the whole plant rather than a single leaf the situation is different, since plants are three-dimensional not flat and different surfaces on the plant face in different directions. In such situations where we wish to obtain an approximate estimate of the quantity of radiation incident on a plant, it is better to use a sphere than a flat radiation meter. This is achieved with a measuring instrument that is equally sensitive to radiation from any direction.\nThis brings us to the distinction between\n\nIrradiance, i.e., radiation power incident on a flat surface of unit area, and\nEnergy fluence rate (or fluence rate for short), i.e., radiation power incident on a sphere of unit cross section. The term fluence rate was introduced by Rupert (1974).\n\nOther terms with the same meaning as energy fluence rate are space irradiance, scalar irradiance and actinic flux. The latter is used mostly by atmospheric scientists. The term spherical irradiance has been used in similar contexts, but means one quarter of the fluence rate. Vectorial irradiance is just the same as irradiance.\nBoth irradiance and energy fluence rate, can also be described in terms of photons. For item [item:irradiance] above, the corresponding photon nomenclature has not yet been standardised. It would be logical to use the term photon irradiance, but many people, especially in the photosynthesis field, use the term photon flux density and the abbreviation PFD (PPFD for PPFD). For item [item:fluence:rate] the term photon fluence rate is well accepted among plant physiologists, but hardly among scientists in general (for example meteorologists call it ‘actinic flux’ or ‘scalar irradiance’). Energy fluence is the energy fluence rate integrated over time. The word energy is frequently omitted, so that ‘fluence’ has the same meaning as ‘energy fluence’. In contrast, when ‘photon fluence’ is meant, the word ‘photon’ is always explicitly mentioned.\nWhen giving a value for irradiance, the direction of the plane for which the irradiance is considered must be specified. This is often the horizontal plane but will depend on the object studied: for instance, the surface a leaf is frequently not horizontal. For collimated radiation (coming from a single direction), irradiance and fluence rate have the same numerical value if the beam of radiation is perpendicular to the plane on which irradiance is measured (Figure [fig:cosine].A). For completely isotropic radiation coming from above (equally from any direction above the horizontal) the fluence rate is twice the irradiance on a horizontal plane (Figure [fig:cosine].C). Sometimes one may also have to consider radiation from below, especially in aquatic environments (Figure [fig:cosine].D).\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nWhen a delimited beam of radiation hits a plane surface perpendicularly, it results in the irradiance, , but the same beam when tilted at an angle \\(\\alpha\\) to the vertical will be more spread out, and thus the irradiance will be lower. More specifically, the irradiance will be \\(\\irr \\cdot \\cos \\alpha\\) (Figure [fig:cosine].B).\n\n\n4.1.3 Spectral irradiance\nWhen we deal with how a quantity of radiation varies with wavelength, for instance when plotting a spectrum, we add “spectral” to the name of the quantity to give “spectral irradiance” and “spectral fluence rate”. We must also adjust the units to account for the width of the part of the spectrum that is included in the value specified (in photobiology nm\\(^{-1}\\) is often used to indicate wavelength interval, but the scale can also be defined in terms of wave number or frequency, as in, cm\\(^{-1}\\) or s\\(^{-1}\\) respectively).\n\n\n4.1.4 Wavelength\nIt is impractical to always quantify radiation by giving its complete spectral composition; so simplifications have to be made that account for the most important features of a spectrum. From a purely physical viewpoint, there are two basic ways of quantifying radiation. Either we express the quantity related to the number of photons, or the quantity related to the energy of radiation. When considering radiation of a single wavelength, the energy of a photon, or quantum (in a vacuum), is inversely proportional to the wavelength and the proportionality constant is Planck’s constant multiplied by the speed of light in a vacuum (see section 7.3). \\[\\quantum(\\lambda) = h \\cdot \\nu = h \\cdot \\frac{c}{\\lambda} \\label{eq:photon}\\] where \\(\\quantum(\\lambda)\\) is a quantum, or the amount of energy that one photon has, \\(h\\) is Planck’s constant (\\(h=6.626\\times 10^{-34}\\) Js), \\(\\nu\\) is frequency, \\(\\lambda\\) is wavelength, and \\(c\\) is the speed of light in a vacuum (\\(c=2.998\\times 10^8\\) m s\\(^{-1}\\)). Please, see section 7.4 on page for a numerical example. When dealing with a band of wavelengths it is necessary to repeat these calculations for each wavelength (in practice a very narrow band) and only then integrate across wavelengths. For example, PAR in units of W m\\(^{-2}\\) is obtained by integrating the spectral irradiance from 400 to 700 nm. As explained in Box [box:quantum:quantities] on page , to determine a quantity in terms of photons, an energetic quantity has to be weighted by the number of photons, i.e. divided by the energy of a single photon at each wavelength from equation [eq:photon]. To get moles of photons, the value has to be divided further by Avogadro’s number (\\(N_A=6.022\\times 10^{23}\\) mol\\(^{-1}\\)). For example, the photon irradiance or in units of is obtained by \\[\\PPFD = \\frac{1}{N_A}\\int_{400\\;\\mathrm{nm}}^{700\\,\\mathrm{nm}}\\frac{\\lambda}{hc}\\;E(\\lambda)\\;\\mathrm{d}\\lambda \\label{eq:ppfd}\\] If we have measured (energy) irradiance, and want to convert this value to photon irradiance, the conversion will be possible only if we have information about the spectral composition of the radiation we measured. For , 1 of “average daylight” (400–700 nm) is approximately 4.6 . This figure is exact only if the radiation is equal from 400 to 700 nm, because it represents the value at the central wavelength of 550 nm. But to make the exact conversion, we must know the spectrum of irradiance measured at the time of measurement, as the solar spectrum varies through the day and with the seasons. In the band this is even more important as the tail of the solar spectrum varies much more than the band. When dealing with lamps, we can sometimes use conversion factors obtained for a particular sensor and lamp combination to convert measured values from energy to photon irradiance. If the lamps are filtered, for example with cellulose diacetate, the spectrum transmitted by the filter will change as the filter ages, and consequently each time irradiance beneath the filter is measured the spectrum of the radiation source (i.e. the lamps) must also be measured.\n\n\n4.1.5 Units used for photons and energy\nRadiation considered as photons can be expressed either as number of photons, or as moles of photons (the symbol for moles is mol). An obsolete term for a mole of photons is an Einstein (E); it should no longer be used. According to Avogadro’s number (\\(N_A\\)), one mole is \\(6.02217 \\times 10^{23}\\) photons, but in most cases a more convenient unit is \\(\\mymu\\)mol (micromole of photons, \\(6.02217 \\times 10^{17}\\) photons). Either of these units can be expressed per time and per area or (rarely in biological contexts) per volume.\nThe unit of energy is a joule (J). Energy per time is power, and a joule per second is a watt (W). Both can be expressed per area (or, rarely in biological contexts, per volume, i.e., energy density or power density). Simply giving a value followed by “” without further qualification is not meaningful and should be avoided, since this leaves the surface you are expressing with m\\(^2\\) undefined. Is it a flat surface or a curved one? If it is flat, what is its orientation? When reporting experimental conditions, all these factors have to be specified.\n\n\n4.1.6 Ratios of UV and visible radiation\nAs already mentioned in section 7.1 on page , it is very important to conduct experiments under realistic environmental conditions. For the control of these experimental conditions, it is helpful—besides using biologically effective exposures—to calculate ratios and . The ratios can also be used for comparison of different experimental conditions or experimental conditions with natural conditions outside in the field, as for example shown in section 8.2.7 on page and in table [tab:typical:irrad:values] on page . For the calculation of these ratios, it is absolutely essential to use the same quantity of radiation or the same weighting procedure, respectively, i.e. energetic units or photon units, but not a mixture. The term “energetic” means that the spectral irradiance is simply integrated over the respective spectral band yielding units like W m\\(^{-2}\\). For the calculation of photon ratios it is also necessary to integrate over the respective spectral bands, but additionally weighted by the number of photons at each wavelength (see section 9.1.4). A function to calculate photon ratios in R is described in section 9.19.4 on page .\n\n\n4.1.7 A practical example\nThe importance of indicating the type of sensor and its orientation is exemplified by the changing ratio of fluence rate to irradiance throughout a day (Figure [fig:fluence:rate:irradiance]). At noon, when the sun is high in the sky the ratio is at its minimum. Even then the ratio remains larger than one because, other than at the equator, the midday sun never reaches the zenith and because the sensor will also always receive diffuse radiation from the whole sky. We can say that when measuring solar radiation the fluence rate will always be numerically larger than the irradiance. Towards both ends of the day the ratio reaches its maximum value because irradiance is being measured on a horizontal plane but the sun is near the horizon. During twilight, particles in the atmosphere will make the distribution of solar radiation more even, allowing a relatively large area of the sky to remain bright, and the ratio decreases again.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n4.1.8 Measuring fluence rate and radiance\nSpherical sensors, as needed for measuring fluence rate, also called scalar irradiance, are not common. LI-COR (Lincoln, NE, USA) sells a spherical quantum sensor (LI-193) that can be submerged, and Biospherical Instruments Inc. (San Diego, CA, USA) makes both PAR- (e.g. QSL-2100 and QSL-2200, terrestrial; QSP series with models that can be submerged to thousands of metres) and also narrowband spherical sensors for measuring UV- and visible radiation fluence rate. Biospherical Instruments Inc. also makes radiance sensors with input optics that have a very narrow acceptance angle. Figure [fig:AMOUR:entrance:optics] shows the different entrance optics available for one series of sensors from Biospherical Instruments. Most broadband UV sensors and entrance optics for spectroradiometers follow a cosine response. L. O. Björn (1995) describes a method for estimating fluence rate from three or six irradiance measurements at a series of specific angles.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n4.1.9 Sensor output\nRadiometer sensors can have either analog or digital outputs. Some sensors with an analogue output have an amplifier next to the detector, others do not. Sensors with an analog output are usually connected to a voltmeter or a datalogger. Some digital sensors are really complete radiometers with a digital output. Examples of radiometers with digital outputs, are shown in Figure [fig:AMOUR]. RS-232 and USB are digital interfaces frequently used to attach these sensors to personal computers[^19].\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n4.1.10 Calibration\nTo calibrate radiation sensors the relationship must be determined between the electrical signal produced by a sensor and the amount of radiation impinging on that sensor. The physical value of irradiance, , of the incoming radiation in energy units, is obtained by “comparison” of a measurement \\(X\\) with that of a calibrated radiation source \\(X_\\mathrm{lamp}\\), \\[\\irr = \\irr[lamp] \\cdot \\frac{X\\cdot a}{X_\\mathrm{lamp}}\\] where \\(\\irr[lamp]\\) is the calibration file of the lamp provided by the calibration survey. The factor \\(a\\) accounts for any difference in the lamp to sensor distance between the survey’s calibration and your own measurement of the lamp. In most modern instruments this “comparison” is implicitly done by the software in the instrument itself, or the computer it is attached to, by multiplying the electrical signal from the detector with a calibration constant. If this is not the case, it is necessary to correct all raw measurements, here \\(X\\) and \\(X_\\mathrm{lamp}\\), before making any further calculations, for example, by subtracting the measurement of dark current (the sensor reading in the dark).\nAlthough photons can be counted using a photomultiplier and appropriate electronics, this approach does not provide an absolute measurement. Some photons are always missed and false counts are included due to thermal excitation. Therefore, absolute calibration of radiation meters can only be provided in energetic terms. For this purpose so-called “blackbody radiators” of known temperature are used, since they depend only on temperature for the total radiation as well as its spectral distribution. Blackbody radiators used for the calibration of lamps, are then available for purchase by scientists for use as secondary standards.\nIn the case of broadband sensors used to measure biologically-effective irradiances or selected bands of the spectrum, the calibration is usually carried out by comparison to readings from a calibrated spectroradiometer under a radiation source with a spectrum as similar as possible to the one which will be measured with the broadband sensor (e.g. sunlight). To calibrate spectroradiometers, in addition to a spectral-irradiance calibration against one or more lamps (with a continuous spectrum, such as an incandescent lamp), it is necessary to do a wavelength calibration against the sun or a lamp (with a an emission spectrum with discrete, narrow and stable peaks, such as a low pressure mercury lamp).\n\n\n4.1.11 Further reading\nL. O. Björn and Vogelmann (1996) treat the same subjects as this section, but in more depth.

    "text": "4.2 Actinometry\nActinometers are chemical systems for the measurement of light and ultraviolet radiation. They do not need to be calibrated by the user, and thus do not require the purchase of an expensive standard lamp with an expensive power supply. Standardization has usually been taken care of by those who have designed the actinometer. Another advantage is that their geometry can more easily be adjusted to the measurement problem. The shape of a liquid actinometer can be made to correspond to the overall shape of the irradiated object under study.\nIn many cases, it is of interest to study a suspension or solution that can be put in an ordinary cuvette for spectrophotometry or fluorimetry, and the actinometer solution can be put into a similar cuvette. A large number of actinometers have been devised. Kuhn, Braslavsky, and Schmidt (1989) lists, briefly describes and gives references for 67 different systems of which they recommend five. In general, actinometers are sensitive to short-wave radiation (\\(&lt;\\)500 nm) and insensitive to long-wave radiation (\\(&gt;\\)500 nm). Insensitivity to long-wave radiation can be both a drawback and an advantage, but by choosing the best actinometer for a particular purpose we can avoid their disadvantages. One advantage of using an actinometer insensitive to long wave radiation is that we can use it for UV work under illumination visible to the human eye, without disturbing the measurement. Here we shall concentrate on the most popular actinometer for ultraviolet radiation—the potassium ferrioxalate or potassium iron(III) oxalate actinometer. In addition to using it directly in some experiments, we can use it for checking the calibration of other instruments, such as spectroradiometers.\nThe description below is sufficient for a researcher starting to work in the field. For more detailed information one should consult Parker (1953; Hatchard and Parker 1956; Lee and Seliger 1964; Goldstein and Rabani 2008). Complete recipes have also been published, e.g., Seliger and McElroy (1965; Jagger 1967). In the ferrioxalate actinometer the following photochemical reaction is exploited:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) (COO)\\(_2^{2-}\\) + Fe\\(^{3+}\\) + photon \\(\\rightarrow\\) CO\\(_2\\) + Fe\\(^{2+}\\)\nor\nOxalate ion + Fe(III) ion + radiation \\(\\rightarrow\\) carbon dioxide + Fe(II) ion\n\n\nThe quantum yield for this reaction (i.e., the number of iron ions reduced per photon absorbed) is slightly wavelength dependent but close to 1.26 in the spectral region, 250–500 nm, where the ferrioxalate actinometer is used. Usually a 1-cm layer of 0.006 M ferrioxalate solution is used. Quantum yield and the fraction of radiation (perpendicular to the 1 cm layer) absorbed are shown in Table [tab:ferrioxlate].\nAs seen from Table [tab:actinometer] the sensitivity of this actinometer (column to the right) is constant throughout most of the UV range, which makes it very convenient for our work.\nThe amount of Fe(II) formed can be measured spectrophotometrically after the addition of phenanthroline, which gives a strongly absorbing yellow complex with Fe(II) ions.\nThe ferrioxalate (actually potassium ferrioxalate) for the actinometer is prepared by mixing 3 volumes of 1.5 M potassium oxalate (COOK\\(_{2}\\)) with 1 volume of 1.5 M FeCl\\(_3\\) and stirring vigorously. This step and all the following procedures involving ferrioxalate should be carried out under red light (red fluorescent tubes or LEDs). The precipitated should be dissolved in a minimal amount of hot water and the solution allowed to cool for crystallization (this crystallization should be repeated twice more). Potassium ferrioxalate can also be purchased ready-made, but the price difference encourages self-fabrication. The following is a recipe for the three solutions required to carry out actinometry (see Goldstein and Rabani 2008 for a different procedure and other quantum yields):\nSolution A: Dissolve 2.947 g of the purified and dried K\\(_3\\)Fe(III) oxalate in 800 ml distilled water, add 100 ml 0.5 M sulfuric acid, and dilute the solution to 1000 ml. This gives 0.006 M actinometer solution, which is suitable for measurement of ultraviolet radiation.\nSolution B: The phenanthroline solution to be used for developing the colour with Fe(II) ions should be 0.1% w/v 1:10 phenanthroline monohydrate in distilled water.\nSolution C: Prepare an acetate buffer by mixing 600 ml of 0.5 M sodium acetate with 360 ml of 0.5 M H\\(_2\\)SO\\(_4\\).\nSolution A is irradiated with the radiation to be measured. The geometries of both the container and of the radiation are important and must be taken into account when evaluating the result. The simplest case is when the radiation is collimated, the container a flat spectrophotometer cuvette, the radiation strikes one face of the cuvette perpendicularly, and no radiation is transmitted. Even in this case one has to distinguish between whether the cuvette or the beam has the greater cross section, and correct for reflection in the cuvette surfaces. The irradiation time should be adjusted so that no more than 20% of the iron is reduced (this corresponds to an absorbance of about 0.66). In the following we shall assume that we use an ordinary fused-silica or quartz spectrophotometer cuvette with 10 mm inner thickness and containing 3 ml actinometer solution.\nAfter the irradiation and mixing of the actinometer solution, 2 ml of the irradiated solution is mixed with 2 ml of solution B and 1 ml of solution C, and then diluted to 20 ml with distilled water. After 30 minutes the absorbance at 510 nm is measured against a blank made up in the same way with unirradiated solution A. An absorbance of 0.5 corresponds to 0.905 \\(\\mymu\\)mol Fe\\(^{2+}\\). It is a good idea to check this relationship with known amounts of FeSO\\(_4\\) if you have not previously checked your spectrophotometer for accuracy and linearity. You should not use any absorbance above 0.65.\nExample of calculation: 3 ml of 0.006 M actinometer solution are irradiated by parallel rays of 300 nm UV-B impinging at right angles to one surface (and not able to enter any other surface). The radiation cross section intercepted by the solution is 2 cm\\(^2\\). Five minutes of irradiation produces an absorbance of 0.6. This corresponds to \\(0.6 \\cdot 0.905/0.5\\) \\(\\mymu\\)mol = 1.086 \\(\\mymu\\)mol Fe\\(^{2+}\\), but since we have taken 2 out of the 3 ml actinometer solution for analysis, multiply by 3/2 to get the total amount of Fe\\(^{2+}\\) formed. Throughout the UV-B region the quantum yield is 1.26, so this corresponds to absorption of \\(3 \\cdot 1.086/2/1.26\\) \\(\\mymu\\)mol photons. Reflection from the surface is estimated to be 7% (by application of Snell’s law, or law of refraction, giving the angle of refraction for an angle of incidence at the boundary of two media like water and glass). None of the radiation penetrates the solution to the rear surface, since the solution thickness is 1 cm. Therefore the incident radiation is \\(3 \\cdot 1.086/(1.26 \\cdot 0.93 \\cdot 2)\\) \\(\\mymu\\)mol = 1.390 \\(\\mymu\\)mol radiation incident on 2 cm\\(^2\\) in 5 minutes, and the photon irradiance (quantum flux density, in this case equal to the photon fluence rate, since the rays are parallel and at right angles to the surface) is 1.390/(2\\(\\cdot\\)5) \\(\\mymu\\)mol/cm\\(^2\\)/min = 0.1390 \\(\\mymu\\)mol/cm\\(^2\\)/min = \\(10000 \\cdot 0.1390/60\\) \\(\\mymu\\)mol/m\\(^2\\)/s = 23.2 \\(\\mymu\\)mol/m\\(^2\\)/s.\nA. D. Kirk and Namasivayam (1983) point out errors that might arise if a more concentrated actinometer solution is used, in order to absorb more light at long wavelengths, and how these errors can be minimized. If an actinometer much more concentrated than 0.006 M is used, the quantum yield is lower, and we do not recommend this for UV research. Goldstein and Rabani (2008), using 0.06 M actinometer solution, find almost the same quantum yield (1.24) from 250 to 365 nm, but much higher (1.47) from 205 to 240 nm; the latter in marked contrast to the values of Fernández, Figuera, and Tobar (1979) in the table above, so measurements below 250 nm should be regarded with caution. Bowman and Demas (1976) warn against exposure of the phenanthroline solution to UV, and even against the fluorescent room lighting.\nChemical or biological systems (mostly in a solid state) for recording solar radiation and particularly radiation, are widely employed for estimating the exposure of people, leaves in a plant canopy, and other objects which for various reasons are not easily amenable to measurements with electronic devices. These chemical devices are generally referred to as dosimeters rather than actinometers, even if there is no defined delimitation between these categories. As the construction, calibration, and use of chemical and other dosimeters have been the subject of frequent reviewing (Bérces et al. 1999; Horneck et al. 1996; Marijnissen and Star 1987), we shall not dwell on them here, only stress that their radiation sensitive components can be either chemical substances (natural such as DNA or provitamin D, or artificial) or living cells (e.g., various spores and bacteria).",

    "section": "4.3 Dosimeters",
    "text": "4.3 Dosimeters\nBroadband dosimeters have been developed to quantify exposure to UV radiation based either upon the photochemical degradation of chemical compounds and plastic films or using biological techniques involving damage to DNA. The range of experimental methods has been described by Dunne (1999) and A. Parisi et al. (2010). The most practical and effective dosimeters for plant studies include the use of plastic films of polysulphone (PS) and poly 2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide (polyphenylene oxide or PPO) (see Geiss 2003; A. Parisi, Schouten, and Turnbull 2010) and the determination of spore viability after UV exposure (see e.g. Quintern et al. 1992, 1994, 1997; Furusawa et al. 1998).\nA commercially available UV-dosimetry system ‘Viospor’ (Biosense, Germany) uses the DNA molecules of microbial spores immobilised in a film mounted in a protective casing with a cosine corrected filter system to provide a measurement of biologically-weighted UV exposure (Figure [fig:UV:dosimeters:VS]). Viospor sensors are available as two types: Viospor blue-line types I-IV which provide estimates of the CIE erythemal exposure (as MED, J m-2, and SED) at a range of exposure levels from seconds to several days, and Viospor red-line which use the DNA damage action spectrum (Setlow 1974) to estimate the DNA damaging capacity of UV-B and UV-C radiation and the efficiency of UV-C germicidal lamps. After exposure, films are incubated in bacterial growth medium to stimulate spore germination and the production of proteins that are stained for densitometric quantification. Exposed dosimeters are returned to the supplier for analysis (BioSense, Dr. Hans Holtschmidt, Laboratory for Biosensory Systems, Postfach 5161, D-53318 Bornheim, Germany. phone: +49-228-653809, fax: +49-228-653809, mailto:mail@biosense.de, internet: http://www.biosense.de).\n \nSmall dosimeters have also been constructed from 30–45 film of the thermoplastic polysulphone and can be used to determine exposure by measuring the increase in absorbance at 330 nm (Geiss 2003; A. Parisi et al. 2010) ideally using an integrating sphere to minimise the effects of scattering (Figure [fig:UV:dosimeters:PS]). Dosimeters can be calibrated in sunlight by comparison with erythemally-calibrated broadband radiometers or against lamp sources using a double monochromator spectroradiometer. Ideally, the calibration should be determined under field conditions appropriate for plant studies and if calibrated outside in sunlight the calibration is only accurate under the prevailing atmospheric ozone column as this modifies the UV spectrum. An erythemal dose can be calculated from 40 polysulphone film using a relationship of the form (see Geiss 2003):\n\\[\\mathrm{Radiation\\ amount}\\ (\\Unit{J\\,m^{-2}})  = 8025\\, (\\Delta \\mathrm{A}_{330})^2 + 1980.8\\, \\Delta \\mathrm{A}_{330}\\]\nwhere is the absorbance at 330 nm before exposure (which should be between 0.105 and 0.133) minus the absorbance at 330 nm after exposure plus a further 24 h in the dark. The film may also be calibrated against other action spectra.\nAccuracy of polysulphone dosimetry has been reported to be \\(\\pm\\)10% if is \\(&lt;\\)0.3 but decreases to \\(\\pm\\)30% for up to 0.4 (Diffey 1987). Greater variability in occurs with increasing duration of exposure and dosimeters saturate at sub-tropical sites in less than one day. However, they have also been modified with a filter to provide an extended dynamic range of exposure (over 3 to 6 days) without the need to replace the dosimeter due to saturation (Alfio V. Parisi and Kimlin 2004). Polysulphone dosimeters have been combined with a PAR dosimeter to investigate the visible and UV radiation environment of plants (A. V. Parisi, Wong, and Randall 1998; A. V. Parisi, Galea, and Randall 2003) and miniature versions have also been developed: \\(1.5~\\Unit{cm} \\times 1.0~\\Unit{cm}\\) with an exposure of a 6 mm disc of polysulphone (A. Parisi et al. 2010).\n \nFor longer exposure periods, dosimeters using an alternative plastic film, PPO, have been found more suitable as they saturate at sub-tropical locations after 5–10 days. The change in absorbance of PPO is quantified at 320 nm and it has been successfully calibrated to erythemal exposures (Lester et al. 2003) and by using a mylar (polyester) filter for estimation of UV-A exposures (Turnbull and Schouten 2008). Both PS and PPO dosimeters have been investigated for underwater use where PPO has been considered viable when calibrated under water (but not using a calibration in air) and under the relevant ozone column conditions of the study (Schouten, Parisi, and Turnbull 2007, 2008). The duration of use of PPO dosimeters in air at sub-tropical locations has been extended from 5 to 10 days by the use of neutral density filters (A. Parisi, Schouten, and Turnbull 2010; Schouten, Parisi, and Turnbull 2010).\nThe use of properly calibrated UV dosimeters can be particularly valuable in plant studies when long-term use of spectroradiometers and broadband radiometers is restricted by availability of electrical supplies or by physical constraints.",

A single thermocouple produces a very small signal, but connecting them in series generates a large signal that is easier to measure. Thermopiles can be either small for use in the laboratory or larger, and protected by a quartz dome for use in the field. Thermopile pyranometers are used to measure solar radiation in the range 285 to 2800 nm. Examples of such instruments are the pyranometers in the CMP series from Kipp & Zonen.

    "section": "4.5 Broadband instruments",
    "text": "4.5 Broadband instruments\nBroadband radiometers are instruments used to measure irradiance over a broad region of the solar (or lamp) spectrum, weighted with an instrument spectral response. A broadband radiometer consists of a sensor that is designed to measure the solar radiation flux density () from a field of view of \\(2\\pi\\) steradians (180, or \\(\\pi\\) radians, when projected on a perpendicular plane). The plane of the sensor is usually positioned horizontally, but it can also be located, for example, parallel to the surface of a leaf.\nUV broadband radiometers integrate over either the UV-A or UV-B band or both, which encompasses the entire UV region of daylight. The names broadband and narrowband refer to the width of the ‘window’ or range of wavelengths to which a sensor responds. The term full-width half-maximum (FWHM) is used to measure this, it means the width of the peak in units of wavelength, measured at half the maximum height of the peak along the \\(y\\)-axis (with the output of the sensor on the \\(y\\)-axis plotted on a linear scale). A narrow band-pass can have a 10 nm or 20 nm FWHM while a wide one can have an 80 nm FWHM for instruments measuring a combination of UV-A and UV-B radiation.\nTheir low cost, fast response (typically milliseconds to seconds), stability and low maintenance requirements make them suitable for continuous monitoring applications. The most common spectral response is one that follows the erythemal action spectrum defined by the Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage, or CIE, (McKinlay and Diffey 1987; A. R. Webb et al. 2011), which describes the response of the human skin to UV radiation (Figure [fig:action:spectra], on page ).\nHowever, erythemally effective can be derived from most UV measuring instruments if the radiation spectrum is known and fairly stable in time such as when measuring sunlight. Hence, in meteorology the UV index is taken as a common factor that should be obtained from the data at every measuring site. Vice versa, using a correction factor to the instrument’s output, actual erythemal irradiance in effective can be calculated. Data from UV broadband instruments are part of a worldwide UV database that is located in the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC) as a part the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) programme of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).\nAs the spectral response of broadband radiometers only approximately follow the needed for the desired response, their use for measuring different radiation sources requires source-specific calibration. The readings of broadband radiometers calibrated for sunlight should not be used to assess doses from lamps without using correction factors obtained by calibration. For measuring lamps and LEDs the use of a spectroradiometer is strongly recommended.\n\n4.5.1 Principle of operation\nThe basic design of broadband instruments has not changed significantly since the introduction of the first erythemally weighted solar radiometer, the Robertson-Berger meter (Robertson 1972; Berger 1976). When direct and scattered solar radiation is transmitted through the transmitting quartz dome, the most common way to obtain an erythemal weighting is to filter out nearly all visible light using -transmitting black-glass blocking filters. The remaining radiation then strikes a sensitive fluorescent phosphor to convert UV-B light to visible light, i.e. green light emitted by the phosphor. This light is filtered again using coloured glass to remove any non-green visible light before impinging on a gallium arsenic or a gallium arsenic phosphorus photodiode used as detector.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nA thermally stable amplifier converts the diode’s output current to a voltage. It drives a line amplifier that provides a low impedance 0 to +4 V DC output signal. Phosphor efficiency decreases by approximately 0.5% K\\(^{-1}\\) and its wavelength response curve is shifted by approximately 1 nm towards the red every 10 K. This latter effect is particularly important because of the slope of the solar radiation curve at these wavelengths. The glass filters, phosphor and photodiode are held at 25 to 50, depending on the manufacturer, to ensure that the output signal is not sensitive to changes in ambient temperature. Temperature stabilization is usually achieved by an internal thermistor that permits independent monitoring of the sensor’s temperature (Figure [fig:Yankee]). The analogue electrical signal produced by the broadband UV instrument is converted into digital format for electronic logging. The sampling frequency is usually between once per second (1 Hz) and once per minute. If the complete data set is not stored then data are saved as averages over periods ranging from 10 minutes to not more than one hour. Sometimes, the variation around the mean is also recorded for each averaging period. This indicates the constancy of the conditions during the averaging period (e.g. sun screening by rapidly changing cloud cover: broken clouds or clear sky or constant cloudiness). The raw signal must be converted into units of erythemal irradiance () using a calibration factor, plus several corrections. These corrections require additional data: solar zenith angle () and ozone column depth at the time of measurement.\nErythemal effective irradiance () is calculated (A. Webb, Gröbner, and Blumthaler 2006): \\[\\irr[CIE] = (\\voltage - \\voltage[d]) \\cdot k \\cdot f(\\SZA, \\TOthree) \\cdot f(\\temperature) \\cdot \\Coscor\\] Where: \\(\\voltage\\) is the measured electrical signal from the radiometer, \\(\\voltage[d]\\) is the electrical offset for dark conditions, \\(k\\) is the calibration coefficient, a constant value determined for specific conditions, e.g. at of 40and a total ozone column of 300 DU[^20]. \\(f(\\SZA, \\TOthree)\\) is a function of the solar zenith angle () and the total column of ozone (), i.e. the function can be expressed as a calibration matrix (or look up table) and is derived as part of the calibration procedure. It is normalized at a solar zenith angle of 40and a total ozone column of 300 DU. For solar zenith angles less than 40, \\(f(\\SZA, \\TOthree)\\) is often nearly unity. \\(f(\\temperature)\\) is the temperature correction function. It is recommended that the instrument is temperature stabilized. If this is not applicable then a correction should be applied, which is complex and not always successful. \\(\\Coscor\\) is the cosine correction function (if necessary, otherwise =1).\nThe quality of the broadband instrument depends on the quality of the protective quartz dome, the cosine response, the temperature stability, and the ability of the manufacturer to match the erythemal curve with a combination of glass and diode characteristics. Instrument temperature stability is crucial, with respect to both the electronics and the response of the phosphor to the incident UV radiation.\nMore recently, broadband instruments are using thin film metal interference filter technology and specially developed silicon photodiodes to measure UV erythemal irradiance. This overcomes many problems connected with the phosphor technology, but on the other hand they have difficulties related to very low photodiode signal levels and filter stability. Silicon carbide () photodiodes have good sensitivity to radiation and are intrinsically blind to visible radiation.\nOther broadband instruments use one of these measurement technologies to measure other regions of the spectrum by using either a combination of glass filters or interference filters. Some manufacturers of these instruments provide simple algorithms to approximate erythemal dosage from the unweighted measurements (WMO 2008).\nThe maintenance of broadband instruments consists of ensuring that the domes are cleaned, the instrument is level, the desiccant (if provided) is active, and the heating/cooling system is working correctly, if so equipped.\n\n\n4.5.2 Some commonly used terrestrial instruments\nThe most common outdoor broadband radiometers are: SL 501 from Solar Light, Inc. (Glenside, PA, USA), YES UVB-1 from Yankee Environmental Systems, Inc. (Turners Falls, MA, USA), UVS-E-T (erythemal), UVS-A-T (UV-A) and UVS-B-T (UV-B) from Kipp & Zonen (Delft, The Netherlands) (Figure [fig:UV:pyranometers]). The principle of operation of these meters is basically the same as described in section 9.5.1. Unlike the other meters, the Scintec UV-S-290-T uses a Teflon diffuser under the quartz dome in front of the filters. These three instruments are temperature stabilized by means of heating elements and temperature sensors. Solar light also sells non-stabilized instruments like the PMA2101 (digital) and PMA1101 (analog), which contain a temperature sensor whose output can be used to correct in silico for the temperature dependency of the UV-B readings.\n  \nBroadband sensors based on special silicon photodiodes are also available, which, are more stable with respect to variation in temperature than those based on phosphors. Delta-Ohm (Padova, Italy), Delta-T Devices (Cambridge, UK) and Sky instruments (Llandrindod Wells, UK) make sensors based on this principle. Examples are the SKU 420, SKU 430, and SKU 440 (UV-A, UV-B, and erythemal, respectively) from Sky Instruments, LP UVA 01/03 and LP UVB 01/03 from Delta-Ohm, and UV3pB-05 and UV3pA-05 from Delta-T devices (Figure [fig:UV:diode:sensors]). All of them are UV radiometers with no temperature stabilization or in-built temperature sensors. International Light Technologies (Peabody, USA) makes a wide array of meters and sensors for measuring radiation. Vital Technologies used to make good UV sensors which were popular some years ago, but the company is no longer in business. Most of these sensors have built-in preamplifiers.\n\n \n\n\n\n4.5.3 Spectral and angular (cosine) response\nRadiation incident on a flat horizontal surface originating from a point source with a defined zenith position will have an intensity value proportional to the cosine of the zenith angle of incidence. This is called the ‘cosine law’ or ‘cosine-response’ (see section 9.1.2 on page ). Ideally, a pyranometer has a directional response, which is the same as the cosine-law. Nevertheless, directional response in a pyranometer is influenced by the quality, dimensions and construction of the (quartz) dome and/or Teflon diffuser. Pyranometer cosine-response is defined in their manufacturers specification as deviation from the ideal cosine-response using the incidence angle up to 80with respect to 1000 irradiance at normal incidence (0). Most sensors deviate considerably from ideal cosine response at angles between 80and 90.\nThe erythemal response of human skin to UV radiation varies with the individual, but for the global evaluation of UV-related health effects to succeed, broadband measurements have to be standardized, which means that the radiometric characteristics of all meters should be identical. The spectral response of every meter should follow exactly the same reference action spectrum and the angular response should not deviate from the cosine response (Leszczynski 2002). Hence, the spectral response of an ideal erythemally weighted radiometer should follow the CIE curve, and the angular response should follow the cosine function. Unfortunately, the angular and spectral response of real erythema meters are far from ideal; moreover, the characteristics vary from one meter unit to another, even within the same meter type (Leszczynski 2002).\nBroadband radiometers that do not follow the CIE erythemal action spectrum as are also used. For some radiometers the spectral response follows a bell-shaped curve centred on the UV-A or UV-B bands (see Figure [fig:UV:sensors:spectra]). Radiometers following the GEN or other spectra commonly used as BSWFs in research with plants, are very seldom used, and they are currently not available commercially. However, almost any UV-B radiometer can be calibrated to measure according to these BSWFs, but such calibrations are valid only when the calibration light source exactly matches the spectrum of the measured light source.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n4.5.4 Calibration and intercomparison\nEach broadband instrument used to measure solar or lamp radiation should be characterized for its spectral and angular response, and its sensitivity to temperature (and if possible humidity). These characteristics should be checked at regular intervals to determine their stability. Also, correction is necessary for each instrument, as no instrument has a spectral sensitivity identical to the erythemal action spectrum.\nTo calibrate a broadband instrument for solar radiation, the basic procedure is to simultaneously measure the spectral irradiance of the sun with a calibrated spectroradiometer and the broadband meter under cloudless sky conditions. The measured spectrum is weighted with the desired spectral sensitivity[^21] of the broadband meter and integrated over all wavelengths relevant for the broadband meter. The result is given in the units [detector-weighted ], relative to a defined wavelength, usually the maximum of the erythemal action spectrum (CIE) at 298 nm or the maximum of the spectral sensitivity of the broadband meter. For different atmospheric conditions, such as different solar elevation or different thickness of the ozone column, the relationship between the detector-weighted spectral integral, measured with a spectroradiometer, and the output of the broadband detector, after cosine correction, should be constant within the uncertainty estimate; if this is not the case, the mismatch indicates that the spectral sensitivity of the broadband meter deviates from the that used to calculate effective irradiances from the spectral irradiance data (e.g. that defined by the CIE standard for erythema), or that the spectroradiometric measurements were incorrectly done (Seckmeyer et al. 2005).\nWhen measuring the output from lamps using broadband sensors calibrated under sunlight, large errors are incurred. In the example shown in Table [tab:broadband:cal:errors], we use Kipp sensors because this manufacturer has published instrument spectral response data plotted on a logarithmic scale. Errors of a similar magnitude should be expected for equivalent sensors from other manufacturers. When measuring the irradiance from lamps under a background of sunlight as in some modulated systems, or when the spectrum changes as occurs when profiling the radiation change with depth in water bodies, other types of instruments like multiband sensors or spectroradiometers are preferable.\n\n\n4.5.5 UV radiation monitoring in growth chambers, greenhouses and phytotrons\nErythemal broadband instruments are widely used to monitor UV radiation levels in growth chambers. Great care must be taken when using such instruments for this purpose since plant action spectra generally deviate from the CIE function. In addition, the reflectance of walls and other surfaces of growth chambers may affect the readings if the cosine response is not good. Great care is needed when artificial light sources are used, because their spectra differ greatly from the solar spectrum for which broadband instruments are normally calibrated. Correction factors for the solar zenith angle and ozone dependence of the calibration factors are based on unfiltered solar spectra, so cannot be applied to measurements performed in such chambers, hence special treatment of data may be necessary. In most cases if absolute readings are needed, the broadband sensor should be calibrated against a double-monochromator spectroradiometer, for each different light source to be measured. Failing to do so can cause huge errors in the measurements of doses as shown in Table [tab:broadband:cal:errors].",

    "text": "4.6 Multi-channel filter instruments\nMultichannel instruments are radiometers that measure a series of fixed, usually narrow, wavelength bands of radiation. They are more rugged and cheaper than high quality spectroradiometers and easier to deploy. Each channel has its own detector (e.g. silicon photodiode) and filter (e.g. interference filters). Usually there is a single diffuser acting as common light collector for all channels. One example of a multichannel instrument is the GUV-2511 from Biospherical Instruments Inc (San Diego, USA) designed to measure cosine-corrected downwelling irradiance at 305, 313, 320, 340, 380, and 395 nm, as well as PAR (400–700 nm). When measuring daylight this allows to monitor UV radiation in key UV wavebands for biological exposure studies. These wavelengths also allow the extraction of cloud optical thickness and total column ozone, two critical variables used in modelling the solar spectrum. Multichannel sensors are mainly used for long-term monitoring of irradiance and its geographic variation. They are also used for ground measurements used to calibrate space-borne instruments carried by satellites.\nRecent multichannel instruments from Biospherical Instruments are modular. They are composed of microradiometers of small size, one for each channel, which together with input optics and filters are used to build the multichannel instruments. Figure [fig:multichannel]\n\n\nThe ELDONET terrestrial dosimeter consists of three broad band sensors, measuring , and irradiance (Figure [fig:ELDONET:terrestrial]). It uses an integrating sphere to collect the light, which reaches the detectors after bouncing on the sphere walls. The autonomous version includes a built-in datalogger. It is waterproof, but it is not submersible. The underwater version is described in section 9.8.3 on page .\n\n\n\nimage",

    "section": "4.7 Spectroradiometers",
    "text": "4.7 Spectroradiometers\nSpectroradiometers[^22] are instruments used to measure spectral irradiance. There are two types of spectroradiometer: 1) scanning spectroradiometers, and 2) array detector spectroradiometers. The former have a single sensor, which is used to sequentially measure the spectral irradiance at each wavelength, while the latter have an array of sensors onto which the refracted spectrum is projected and measured simultaneously at all wavelengths. Sometimes the more general term spectrometer is adopted to indicate that the same instrument can be also used to measure spectral absorbance, -transmittance, or -reflectance, in addition to spectral irradiance. Scanning spectroradiometers scan a range of wavelengths. To do this they require mechanically moving parts inside the optic path and therefore need very stable housing for the instrument. For this reason, scanning spectroradiometers are larger and more difficult to transport than array detector spectroradiometers. They are also less rugged and usually require mains power. However, in scanning spectroradiometers it is possible to use a double monochromator arrangement that makes their optical performance far superior to that of array spectroradiometers which always use a single monochromator.\n\n4.7.1 Scanning spectroradiometers\n\n4.7.1.1 Basic structure and principles of operation\nThe basic components of a scanning spectroradiometer are the following: a) input optics for collecting radiation from the sky and guiding it further into the spectroradiometer b) a monochromator for resolving the input radiation into separate wavelengths c) a photomultiplier tube (PMT) for detecting the energy possessed by each spectral component in the measured spectrum. In addition, an external computer for communication with the microprocessor of the spectroradiometer and for collection, processing and storage of data is needed.\nThe input optics typically consists of a flat teflon diffuser covered by a quartz dome. The diffuser collects the incident photons from the overhead hemisphere. The resulting diffuse radiation is guided to the entrance slit of the monochromator, sometimes by means of an optical fibre. The monochromator may be a single or a double monochromator (see section 8.2.4 on page ). In scanning spectroradiometers, a system based on a step motor drives a mask that allows only photons of a certain wavelength at a time to enter the exit slit of the monochromator. The exit slit serves as the entrance window to the cathode of the PMT. The photon pulses are amplified and transmitted to a photon counter for registration.\nSome spectroradiometers are constructed on a solar tracker that follows the position of the sun. This eliminates the effects of potential azimuthal dependencies in the detection of radiation. A measurement head at the end of an optical fibre may be also installed on a separate sun tracker. The temperature of the instrument is usually either stabilized or kept above a certain temperature limit to ensure proper functioning. The dome of the measurement head may be equipped with a heater and/or air blower to keep the temperature of the teflon within certain limits and to avoid emergence of frost onto the dome.\nOther spectroradiometers are less rugged and are intended for laboratory or spot measurements outdoors. They are more portable but more sensitive to temperature extremes and are not water proof. Examples of such instruments are Optronics OL 756 and Macam SR9910 spectroradiometers. Figure [fig:Optronics:OL_756] shows the different parts of the first of these instruments.\n\n\nThe more rugged instruments, usually permanently installed at a fixed location, are commonly used for measuring long (several years long) time series of spectral irradiance data. The more portable instruments are used for spot measurements in plant canopies, and under lamps, and or filters. The first type of instrument is most commonly used by meteorologists, while the portable instruments are most useful to biologists.\n\n\n4.7.1.2 Characteristics\nDark current and dead time are characteristics possessed by the PMT. Dark current is a measure of the drift photons going from the cathode to the anode of the PMT without any real incident photons entering the instrument. Dead time is a measure of that PMT which is in a paralysed state after a photon detection event. Stray light is composed of photons echoed from wavelengths other than the nominal wavelength being measured. In commercially available scanning spectroradiometers, these phenomena are usually measured and handled by the measurement software.\nThe wavelength alignment of a spectroradiometer has to be checked regularly. Most instruments taking daily measurements contain an internal mercury lamp aimed at ensuring the stability of the alignment. The wavelength and the position of the micrometer turning the grating of the monochromator are related to each other by a second-order equation using so called dispersion coefficients. The determination of the dispersion coefficients should be part of the annual maintenance of the instruments.\nSolar irradiance spectra sometimes exhibit so called noise spikes, which mean sudden abnormally high or low intensity readings on a single wavelength. The origin of the spikes is not fully resolved, but straylight is considered a partial explanation. The spikes can be detected and eliminated making use of suitable reference spectra.\nIdeally, the angular response of the measurement head follows the shape of a cosine curve. In practice, the response deviates somewhat from this. Typically, the larger the solar zenith angle, the larger the deviation. The cosine response of the measurement head should be measured in laboratory and a corresponding correction applied to all measured data.\nIf the spectroradiometer is not stabilized for temperature, its response usually exhibits temperature dependence. This dependence should be determined in the laboratory by measuring a calibration lamp with a spectroradiometer heated/cooled over a range of different wavelengths. The measurements can be used for deriving the temperature correction factors to be applied in the post-processing of the sky measurements.\nThe slit function determines the transmittance of a monochromator as a function wavelength. The ideal shape of the function would be triangular. The full width at half maximum of the slit function is commonly used as a quantity characterizing the slit function. The slit function can be derived by measuring the irradiance emitted by a tunable laser. Removal of the effect of the slit function on the measured spectra should be considered if spectra measured by two or several instruments are to be compared with each other.\nThe spectral responsivity of a spectroradiometer should be based on regular measurements of a certified calibration lamp. If the responsivity seems to have changed, basically two alternative ways to handle the change exist. The change may be introduced in the responsivity of the instrument and the processing of the sky measurements as such. A step-wise change in response is hence introduced in the time series of the measurements. Alternatively, a gradually changing response time-series may be defined using a moving average with a suitable time window. In this way, the change in the response is introduced gradually in the time series of the sky irradiance measurements.\n\n\n4.7.1.3 Maintenance\nThe maintenance of a scanning spectroradiometer operating in an outdoor environment involves the following practices: a) general daily maintenance; b) checks on the wavelength setting and stability of irradiance scale; c) calibration of irradiance against primary standards in a dark room.\nDaily routine maintenance includes cleaning of the quartz dome and checking on the general functioning as well as the correct levelling of the instrument. The quartz dome should also be cleaned/dried after rain or snow. The operator should be familiar with the control software of the instrument. Additional simple routines based on, for instance, selected reference spectra may be used for instant checking of the measured data. These kinds of routines are invaluable in the prompt detection of occasional malfunctions of the instrument.\nAn internal Hg lamp is used for checking of the wavelength scale in some spectroradiometers. In these cases, it is convenient to imbed the Hg lamp measurement into the daily measurement schedule. If the instrument lacks an internal lamp, this check has to be done using an external lamp. For checking the stability of the irradiance scale, portable calibration units are available. These enable, for instance, stability checks of the instrument at the measuring site on a weekly basis. It is advisable that the humidity indicators are also checked on a weekly basis.\nIrradiance calibration of a spectroradiometer should be performed in a dark room (Figure [fig:Brewer:calibration]). A primary standard lamp with an irradiance certificate provided by a certified laboratory of standards is needed. To extend the lifetime of the primary standard lamp, it is recommended that it is not used as a regular calibration lamp. Instead, the irradiance scale of the primary lamp should be transferred to a secondary standard lamp that is used as a working calibration lamp. Use of several working lamps is recommended to enable recognition of potential drifts in the radiant output of the lamps as they age. Calibration against the primary/secondary standard lamp should be performed at least every two months. The desiccant bags inside the cover of the spectrometer should be taken out and dried at least every two months as well. Proper levelling of the instrument has to be ensured after having it relocated for outdoor measurements.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nOn the annual maintenance practices of a spectroradiometer, each manufacturer has its own services and recommendations. Participation in intercomparison campaigns gathering a number of state-of-the-art instruments to conduct measurements on a jointly agreed schedule for a period of time has proven a fruitful way to investigate the long-term stabilities and overall performances of scanning spectroradiometers (Figure [fig:Brewer:intercomparison]).\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n4.7.2 Array detector spectroradiometers\nIn contrast to scanning spectroradiometers, array detector instruments measure spectral irradiance simultaneously at all wavelengths. The detector in this case is a linear array of light sensors, similar in structure to the imaging sensors used in digital cameras, but long and narrow. The number of detector elements (‘pixels’) along the array varies, 2000 to 3000 pixels being common[^23]. The array can be a ‘charge coupled device’ (CCD), or an array of photodiodes (DAD). The ‘image’ of the spectrum produced by the monochromator is projected and focused by means of mirrors onto the linear detector array, each detector in the array receiving light of a certain wavelength. In the case of array spectrometers it is not possible to use two monochromators in tandem to reduce stray light. Array spectrometers are small and portable (Figure [fig:Maya2000Pro]).\n \nFor measuring energy or photon spectral irradiance a cosine diffuser is used as input optics. This ensures that the angular response follows the cosine law, and so the instrument measures the radiation as received on a flat surface. Other input optics are also available, for example, with a narrow angle of view. However, the quantity measured with them is not irradiance. Cosine diffusers differ widely in how closely they follow the cosine law. Some cheaper models are prone to large errors, especially when radiation impinges at a sharp angle to their surface. This will be further discussed in section 9.7.2.1 on page .\nThe input optics is usually connected to the array spectrometer with an optical fibre. The type of fibre to be used depends on the wavelength range to be measured. If smaller than the entrance of the spectroradiometer, the diameter of the fibre will affect the amount of radiation entering the instrument. The diameter also affects the mechanical properties of the fibre: thin fibres are more flexible and tolerate bending into curves of smaller diameter. Fibres also vary with regards to the type of cladding material used to protect them. Fibres with metal cladding tolerate rougher handling than those with plastic cladding. The most common connector for these fibres and accessories is the SMA 905, originally designed for light fibres used in digital communication systems. For this reason their positioning upon repeated attachment is not exactly the same. Consequently, the recommendation is not to detach and reattach the fibre from the spectrometer without recalibrating the system[^24].\nAt the entrance of the spectrometer, just behind the connector to which the fibre is attached, there is a slit (Figure [fig:CCD:slit]), which limits the width and height of the incoming light beam. The width is of the order of a few micrometres and the exact value chosen determines, together with the monochromator, the spectral resolution of the spectroradiometer. The narrower the slit, the narrower the beam hitting the monochromator and the better the resolution (the narrower the peaks that can be resolved). In a Czerny-Turner configuration (Figure [fig:optical:bench]), the next component is a collimating mirror which projects the beam onto a monochromator. Gratings are used as monochromators. Gratings have a surface with very closely spaced rulings of a specific profile, and they separate radiation of different wavelengths in a similar way to a prism. One important parameter is the density of rulings which is one of the determinants of spectral resolution and useful wavelength range. The ‘image’ produced by the grating is focused onto the array detector by another collimating mirror. Some newer models of spectrometer from StellarNet (e.g. BLACK-Comet spectrometer) and now also from Ocean Optics (Torus spectrometer) use a concave grating instead of a planar one. Since the grating itself focuses the light onto the array detector, collimating mirrors are not needed. Having fewer optical components, an instrument with better stray light performance is obtained.\n\n \n\n\n \n\nThe array detector normally has rectangular ‘pixels’, orientated so that their shorter dimension is on the axis along which the different wavelengths have been separated by the monochromator, and their longer dimension is perpendicular to it. The entrance slit is positioned to have the long dimension coincident with the long dimension of the pixels. In some detectors the long pixels are in reality rows of square pixels with their electrical output combined into a single output signal. The output signal from the pixels is averaged by the detector itself over what is called ‘integration time’. The longer the integration used, the lower the irradiance that can be measured. However, the ‘dark noise’ increases with the integration time. In addition, it is possible to take several scans and average them. A coarse dark noise correction is sometimes done by subtracting the signal from special pixels at the end of the array that are not exposed to radiation. However a dark scan, with the input optics protected from the incoming radiation, should also be measured, and its value, wavelength by wavelength subtracted from the measurements. The dark noise depends on temperature. This has two implications, dark scans should be taken frequently, sometimes before or after each measurement, and the spectrometer should be allowed to warm up for some minutes before starting to take readings. Furthermore, when working outdoors it should be protected from direct sunlight, so as to keep its temperature stable and close to that at which it was calibrated. Some spectrometers have a thermoelement (TE), working according to the Peltier principle, which cools the array detector to a preset temperature and thereby stabilizes it.\nMost current array spectrometers, the exception being some models with thermoelectrically cooled detectors, are powered through the USB port of a personal computer. For portable use a laptop is frequently used. Special software, sold by the manufacturer of the spectrometer, is used to control the instrument and acquire and plot the spectra (Figure [fig:SpectraSuite]). For most instruments there are also drivers and software development kits (SDK) available for developing programs for special applications. When special corrections, for example for stray light, are performed it may be necessary to acquire raw spectral data and apply corrections and calibrations off-line using other software, for example Excel or R.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n4.7.2.1 Measuring errors and limitations in accuracy\nArray spectroradiometers have a great advantage when quickly measuring changing radiation as they acquire all wavelengths simultaneously. This ensures that the values of spectral irradiance measured at all wavelengths are consistent. In contrast, under conditions where irradiance varies rapidly with time, the shape of the measured spectrum can get badly distorted when measured with a scanning spectroradiometer. However, array spectrometers have a serious limitation in that they cannot be built with double monochromators. As any spectroradiometer with a single monochromator, they suffer from relatively high values of stray light. Stray light originates from scattered light of incorrect wavelengths falling on a pixel of the array detector. In other words, radiation of one wavelength is detected (and measured) as radiation of a different wavelength. Perfectly scattered radiation would affect all pixels in the same way, but when there are reflections within the optical bench that are not perfectly scattered, some pixels in the array detector are more affected by stray light than others. Stray light is a critical specification when measuring UV-B in sunlight, as UV-B irradiance is very low compared to the irradiance of visible and near infra-red radiation. Consequently, if even a small proportion of visible radiation is scattered and reflected as stray light within the instrument, this stray light can generate a signal on the ‘UV-B pixels’ of the array of a magnitude similar to, or larger than, that produced by the radiation that we are trying to measure. Stray light is such a big problem that without very complicated and special corrections these instruments cannot be used at all to measure radiation in sunlight. Errors of more than 100%[^25] for biologically effective doses can be incurred even with a well calibrated instrument. Failure to take this into account has led to important mistakes, like the erroneous measurement of solar radiation at ground level by NASA researchers which was published in Geophysical Research Letters. This was most likely an artifact due to the limitations of the array spectrometer used. See the paper by D’Antoni et al. (2007) and the refutation by Stephan D. Flint et al. (2008) and the answer by D’Antoni, Rothschild, and Skiles (2008). Equally, the values of the UV-B doses used in many recent biological experiments, as reported in the publications, are suspect, since they have been based on measurements performed with single-monochromator instruments.\nGratings disperse radiation according to what are called ‘orders’. For example first order dispersion may be 10 nm/mm, second order dispersion 5 nm/mm, third order dispersion 2.5 nm/mm, and so on. The first order spectrum is what is of interest, and is what we want the array detector to see. However, any given ‘pixel’ in the array, in addition to radiation corresponding to the first order (e.g. 800 nm), also sees radiation corresponding to higher orders (e.g. 400 nm, 266.6 nm, 200 nm, and so on) if those wavelengths are present in the incoming radiation. The solution to this problem is to use ‘order-sorting filters’ in the light pass. In array spectrometers order-sorting filters may be directly coated onto the array detector, or attached to it. For example Ocean Optics spectrometers can be bought with a variable longpass order-sorting filter as an option (Figure [fig:CCD:slit]).\nAnother problem with array detector spectrometers is that the radiation may be better focused on some parts of the array than on others, and this causes changes in spectral resolution with changing wavelengths. In addition, the wavelength difference between adjacent pixels is not always the same across the whole spectrum, neither is the step size an integer number. Usually the software supplied with the instrument can generate files with data at integer steps (e.g. 1 nm, or 5 nm) but this is done by interpolating and averaging, rather than changing the measurement itself. In contrast the scanning step of scanning spectroradiometers can be controlled through its software.\nThe overall accuracy of the measurements is also reliant on the angular response of the entrance optics. For measuring spectral irradiance we generally use a cosine diffusor as entrance optics, although it is also possible to use an integrating sphere. Deviations of cosine diffusers from the theoretical angular response tend to increase at large angles from the vertical. If the spectrum of the light coming from different angles is different (e.g. sun and sky) not only the irradiance measured may be inaccurate but also the shape of the spectrum may be distorted. When measuring outdoors, the size of this error will change through a day as the sun moves across the sky. The very small cosine diffusers sold by the spectrometer manufacturers tend to be prone to large errors, and individually calibrated, high quality diffusers like the D7-SMA and D7-H-SMA from Bentham (see section 9.20 on page for full address) are preferable, although they are much more expensive (Figure [fig:Bentham:diffuser]).\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n4.7.2.2 Calibration and corrections\nWhen measuring UV-B with an array spectroradiometer it is not enough to have it properly calibrated, its optical characteristics (slit function at different wavelengths, stray light properties) need to be measured and a correction algorithm developed and later applied to each measurement. This makes the use of array spectroradiometers for characterizing UV-B doses complicated and error prone. This type of use has to be attempted only by experienced operators and the correction algorithm itself requires lots of effort to develop and implement. Given the lack of standardized procedures for stray light correction, its implementation requires advanced knowledge of optics and metrology. We will first discuss spectral calibration and thereafter stray light correction procedures.\nSpectral calibration against standard lamps needs to be repeated regularly. For measurements not requiring very high precision, annual re-calibrations may be enough. However, the main consideration should be how valuable is the data that will be acquired. If the spectral sensitivity of the instrument has changed significantly from one calibration to the next, the data from all measurements done in between these calibrations are suspect, and should be discarded. Consequently if one does yearly re-calibrations one can lose one year’s worth of data, while if one does monthly re-calibrations one only risks losing one month’s worth of data. Consequently, the decision on how frequently to calibrate should, in addition to instrument stability, be based on the maximum size of the tolerable errors and on the value of the data (i.e. the cost of replacing the data if they need to be discarded).\nThe most common and stable calibration light sources are incandescent lamps (e.g. FEL lamps) with electronics in the power source which keeps the electrical power at the filament constant within very narrow margins. The distance between the lamp and the entrance optics, and their alignment, should also fall within a very narrow margin of the expected values. Calibration lamps are secondary or tertiary standards, connected by a chain of calibration steps to a standard kept at a metrology agency like NIST. Calibration lamps are supplied with spectral data about their emission characteristics. Calibration of the instrument is done by measuring the known spectrum and irradiance of the calibration lamp. Of course the output of the lamp will not exactly match the data supplied with it, because its original calibration is also subject to errors. Furthermore, there are errors deriving from slight differences between the burning conditions (current and voltage) during measurements and those when it was calibrated at the factory. Further errors can be introduced by small differences in the geometry of the optical setup. So, do not forget that calibrations are subject to errors. Furthermore, you cannot obtain an absolute estimate of calibration errors by comparing two instruments calibrated with the same lamp, unless this lamp is the primary standard.\nCalibrating a spectroradiometer in the UV-B band with a FEL lamp is not recommended, because FEL lamps emit very little UV-B. For calibration in the UV-B deuterium lamps need to be used. Irradiance emitted by deuterium lamps is less stable than that emitted by FEL lamps. For coarse calibration the use of a deuterium lamp may be enough, but for accurate calibration it is best to use FEL and deuterium lamps in tandem. The shape of the spectrum emitted by deuterium lamps is stable, by matching the irradiances at wavelengths where the emission of both types of lamps overlap, one can extend an accurate calibration to shorter wavelengths. Spectrometer manufacturers also sell calibration light sources (lamp plus electronics) that may be good for routine calibration or especially for checking that calibrations performed in an optical bench remain valid. Again, what type of calibration procedure and lamp to use will depend on the accuracy required. If we want our measurements to be within \\(\\pm 10\\)% of the true value we will need to use very good equipment and protocols for the calibration. If we can tolerate errors of, for example, \\(\\pm 25\\)%, calibrations can be less accurate.\nIt is also very important to do a wavelength calibration and to check this calibration regularly. It should not be forgotten when doing this calibration that it is affected by the temperature of the instrument as temperature affects (by thermal expansion) the dimensions of the optical bench and its components. Wavelength calibration is done based on elemental emission lines in discharge lamps (or even the sun). For quick checks low pressure mercury or germicidal lamps may be used. The manufacturers of spectrometers also sell special light sources for wavelength calibration. One should choose carefully which wavelengths to use (for example 253.652 nm, 296.728 nm, 334.148 nm, and 404.657 nm for mercury lamps, as they are simple peaks rather than multiple peaks very close together like those at 302 nm, 313 nm and 365 nm). If one desires a calibration accurate to a fraction of the wavelength step of the array one needs to fit a bell-shaped curve to the pixel showing the highest signal and those adjacent to it, to find the true location of the peak centre, most likely in-between two pixels.\nTo keep errors within \\(\\pm 10\\)% in the UV-B when measuring sunlight, and especially to keep errors within \\(\\pm 10\\)% for biologically effective doses, a good calibration is not enough when using single monochromator spectroradiometers. There is also a need to correct for stray light. If we do not correct for stray light some biologically effective doses will be overestimated by more than 100%. The ratio between stray light in the UV-B band and the maximum spectral irradiance measured in good single monochromator spectrometers is approximately 1\\(\\times 10^{-3}\\), while in double monochromator spectroradiometers it can be as low as \\(1 \\times 10^{-6}\\). If time for scanning, cost and lack of portability are no obstacles, it’s preferable to use double monochromator instruments and these should also be used as the main instrument in a laboratory.\nWhen applying the stray light correction, a thorough characterization of the slit function at different wavelengths and a check of the wavelength dependence of stray light are needed. This characterization does not need to be repeated, unless changes are made to the optical bench of the instrument. So, in contrast to the spectral calibration, the stray light characterization needs to be performed only once during the lifetime of the instrument unless major repairs or modifications are made.\nIn some array spectrometers, depending on the configuration, the width of the slit function may vary with the wavelength. This can introduce errors that are very difficult to correct. In some cases it might be preferable to chose a grating giving the instrument a relatively narrow wavelength range, for example 250 nm to 500 nm if the intended use is to measure irradiance.\nThe use and calibration of array spectroradiometers for measurement of UV-B radiation in sunlight is discussed in detail in the WMO report by Seckmeyer, Bais, Bernhard, Blumthaler, Drüke, et al. (2010). Stray light correction methods are discussed in the papers by Ylianttila et al. (2005), Coleman, Sarkany, and Walker (2008), and Kreuter and Blumthaler (2009) and the references therein.",

    "section": "4.8 Underwater sensors and profiling",
    "text": "4.8 Underwater sensors and profiling\n\n4.8.1 Measuring underwater UV radiation\nMeasuring UV radiation in the aquatic environment is difficult. Waterproof UV-measuring devices are needed or sensors protected in water proof housings as well as a means of deploying the sensors at the desired depth. Frequently, underwater measurements are referenced to the (spectral) irradiance at the surface of the water body, measured simultaneously with a matched “atmospheric” or terrestrial sensor.\nAs was mentioned in section 7.6 on page , measurement of the underwater UV field presents particular complexities, mainly related to variable attenuation occurring in different water bodies (J. T. O. Kirk 1994). Depending on the physical and chemical characteristics of the water, irradiance may decrease much more rapidly than irradiance (this phenomenon is known as ‘spectral leakage’), resulting in a changing spectrum with depth. Thus, underwater UV instruments are normally equipped with different filters and photodiodes to minimize these effects and to improve the sensitivity to particular wavelengths of interest. As discussed above in section 9.5.4 on page , errors are introduced if the spectrum being measured differs from that of the source used for calibration of the broadband instrument. This implies that when using broadband sensors underwater the errors will depend on the depth at which the radiation is being measured. In addition, a general problem exists for broadband sensors and spectrometers if sensors are only calibrated in air. The same calibration function cannot be used with the sensor in air and in water. Wavelength-dependent correction factors, so called immersion factors, must be used to adjust the signal if sensors are immersed in water as for example described by (Ohde and Siegel 2003).\nWater movement and weather conditions can affect the measurements of underwater UV radiation. For an accurate determination of UV radiation in the field, sunny, cloudless conditions and calm waters are preferred. The effect of waves may cause difficulties especially when measuring near the surface. On the other hand, clouds and other atmospheric UV absorbing phenomena can alter the conditions during the measurement of vertical light profiles, especially when the diffuse component of the beam is altered.\nSolar zenith angle is an important factor which affects the irradiance above the water surface, and also the reflectance of the water surface for the wavelengths of biological relevance. In addition, the RAF (RAF, see also section [sec:RAF]), can be used to estimate the effect of changes in the ozone column on biologically effective exposure. Corrections can be applied to measurements performed with broadband instruments, but measurements with narrow-band multi-filter instruments and spectroradiometers are less error prone.\nIf our objective is to describe the characteristics of the waters, radiation should be measured around solar noon, when solar elevation is maximal. However, if we are interested in describing the daily exposure of some organism, measurements should be done preferably during most of the day and at the depths of interest.\n\n\n4.8.2 Profiling\nProfiling is the measurement of irradiance or spectral irradiance as a function of depth in a water body. Special frames are used for lowering the instruments through the water. For light measuring instruments, the frame or rig should not occlude the field of view of the radiation sensors. A means of determining the depth at which the sensor is located, and any deviation from a vertical orientation should also be available. Suitable cabling is used to connect the underwater sensors to onboard computers or dataloggers.\n\n\n4.8.3 Underwater radiometers\nVarious underwater radiometers are currently available and their accuracy and characteristics vary considerably. The most appropriate instrument to choose depends on the specific goals of a study. Different types of radiometers include broadband radiometers, narrow-band multifilter radiometers, photodiode array spectroradiometers, and scanning spectroradiometers, including single monochromator spectroradiometers. Comparisons of the main characteristics of different types of instruments have been published (J. T. O. Kirk 1994; Díaz, Morrow, and Booth 2000; Kjeldstad et al. 2003; Tedetti and Sempére 2006). Some commonly-used underwater instruments are described below.\nThe ELDONET radiometers (Real Time Computer, Germany) were developed within the framework of the European light dosimeter network (Figure [fig:Eldonet]) and have been described in detail (Häder et al. 1999). The dosimeters are three-channel broadband filter devices with an entrance optic consisting of an integrating Ulbricht sphere with an internal BaSO\\(_4\\) coating (Khanh and Dähn 1988). Silicon photodiodes (BPX60 for the PAR range and SFH291 for the two UV wavebands, both from Siemens, Germany) are used in combination with custom-made filters to select the wavelength ranges for UV-B (280–315 nm), UV-A (315–400 nm) and PAR (400–700 nm), a custom-made interference filter for UV-B (Janos Technology, Townshend, VT, USA), a DUG 11 band filter for UV-A (Schott & Gen., Mainz, Germany) and a broad band filter for PAR (WBHM, Optical Coating Laboratory, Santa Rosa, CA, USA). Eldonet performs 60 measurements each minute.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nSubmergible multichannel radiometers like PUV 500, PUV 2500 series from Biospherical Instruments (San Diego, USA) are equipped with narrow-band filter detectors in the range of UV and PAR (Figure [fig:PUV]). These radiometers are equipped with depth and temperature sensors and thus are well suited for accurate light profiling. The spectral characteristics of the five filters used in the PUV 500 instrument are as follows: 305\\(\\pm\\)1 nm (band pass 7\\(\\pm\\)1 nm) 320\\(\\pm\\)2 nm (band pass 11\\(\\pm\\)1 nm) 340\\(\\pm\\)2 nm (band pass 10\\(\\pm\\)1 nm) 380\\(\\pm\\)2 nm (band pass 10\\(\\pm\\)1 nm)\nOn the other hand, the PUV 2500 measures 7 (optionally 8) wavebands of downwelling irradiance (305, 313, 320, 340, 380, 395 nm and PAR: 400–700 nm) with one upwelling radiance channel (natural fluorescence). Each channel with 10 nm FWHHM except 305 (controlled by atmospheric ozone cutoff). The instrument includes pressure/depth sensing (350 m maximum) and temperature control. A 32 channel multiplexer selects signals from 8 photodetectors, temperature, pressure and tilt/yaw detector. The cosine collector is made of Teflon-covered quartz for use in the water.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nThe RAMSES family of hyperspectral radiometers (Trios GmbH, Germany) are miniature single monochromator spectrometers with a resolution of 2 to 3 nm per pixel and 100 or 190 usable channels in the photodiode array (Figure [fig:RAMSES]). They can be used in air or in water. The Ramses ACC-UV is an integrated UV hyperspectral radiometer, and the Ramses ACC-VIS is a and visible hyperspectral radiometer, both equipped with a cosine collector. Ramses ASC-VIS is equipped with a spherical collector shielded so as to measure radiation from one hemisphere. To measure scalar irradiance, two of these sensors can be deployed pointing in opposite directions. They are calibrated for underwater and air measurements (two different calibrations). The device has a small size, the signal capture requires some power consumption and portable (laptop) terminal at the surface. The detector type is a silicon photodiode array designed to capture wavelengths between 320–950 nm for VIS models and 280–500 nm for the UV models, with an irradiance accuracy better than 6–10% depending on the spectral range.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nAlthough the LI-1800UW instrument is not currently produced by LI-COR, many foundational studies focused on UV penetration during the 1980s and 1990s were carried out using this spectroradiometer. The optics of this scanning spectroradiometer is based on a single holographic monochromator grating, a silicon detector and a filter wheel to improve stray light rejection. The wavelength range is between 300 and 850 nm, with a bandwidth of 8 nm and accuracy of \\(\\pm\\)1.5 nm. Originally optional slits of different widths were available, so these specifications vary with the exact configuration used. The whole optical bench and the microcomputer system is contained in the massive waterproof housing designed for measurements to a depth close to 200 m. Being a single monochromator instruments its accuracy is limited by stray light when used to measure -B radiation in daylight.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nThe OL 754-O-PMT Spectrometer Optics Head (Optronic Laboratories) is based on a double monochromator for low stray light and measuring from 300 to 850 nm. Configurations with other gratings giving different wavelength ranges are available. The system utilizes holographic gratings with peak efficiencies at 300 nm. The instrument can be fitted with an OL IS-470-WP Submersible Sphere Assembly (4-inch integrating sphere) attached by means of quartz optical fibre to the non-submersible spectroradiometer. The sphere follows a dual port design with an entrance port and an exit port located 90\\(^\\circ\\) apart. The sphere contains an internal baffle in front of the exit port to permit only light reflected by internal surface of the sphere to exit the sphere and enter the fibre.\nAnother approach to measuring underwater radiation is to protect a regular sensor, as for example, those described in section 9.5.2 on page , within a hermetic water-proof housing (Figure [fig:sensor:in:box]). Of course the enclosure should have an transparent window, and the sensors must be calibrated inside the enclosure.",

    "section": "4.9 Modelling",
    "text": "4.9 Modelling\nFor locations and times not covered by measurements, alternative approaches have to be considered for estimating the prevailing radiation conditions. For this purpose, various methods for modelling the surface UV radiation have been developed. These range from simple theoretical-empirical methods for estimating the clear-sky surface radiation to more sophisticated methods that account also for the effects of clouds as inferred either from ground-based station data or satellite measurements. Table [tab:modelling:methods] gives a simplified view of the main features of methods that are available for modelling the surface UV radiation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple theoretical-empirical methods, such as those of L. O. Björn and Murphy (1985) and Bird and Riordan (1986), have been widely used thanks to their fairly simple user interface. These methods provide spectral surface irradiances, optionally on tilted surfaces, and account for the main parameters affecting the surface radiation conditions under cloudless skies. Results indicate that they predict the surface radiation with reasonable accuracy as compared to more detailed radiative transfer calculations and measurements (Bird and Riordan 1986).\nAnother user-friendly alternative is to use an interactive web-based interface to radiative transfer simulations, such as the FastRT (Engelsen and Kylling 2005 available at http://nadir.nilu.no/~olaeng/fastrt/fastrt.html) or the QUICK TUV (http://cprm.acd.ucar.edu/Models/TUV/Interactive_TUV/). Both of these are based on rigourous radiative transfer models, which means that their accuracy depends mainly on the choice of values for the input parameters. Both include a selection of biological weighting functions, and FastRT also provides the possibility to account for the effect of clouds.\nWhen cloud effects need to be accounted for in detail, either satellite methods or so-called reconstruction methods should be considered. The reconstruction methods usually rely on ground-based measurements of some kind for accounting for the effect of clouds on radiation. Although the methods vary in their exact approach, the idea of all of them is to utilize available observations to account for the parameters that affect the amount of UV radiation reaching the surface. These parameters are, most importantly, clouds, total ozone column, surface albedo, atmospheric aerosols, and altitude or pressure. In addition, the solar zenith angle determines the path length of the direct:rad through the atmosphere and is therefore the single most important factor for the surface UV radiation. The Earth-Sun distance, which varies over the course of the year, also needs to be accounted for.\nMany station-based methods for reconstructing the surface radiation were included in recent European efforts to gain a better understanding of past radiation and its climatological behaviour (Koepke et al. 2006; den Outer et al. 2010). Similar methods have been proposed and applied in other parts of the world as well (V. I. Fioletov et al. 2001; V. E. Fioletov et al. 2004). Compared to satellite methods, the advantage of the station-based methods is that they tend to give more accurate estimates of the surface UV radiation. In particular, methods using (300–3000 nm), measured by pyranometers at numerous stations worldwide, as input for determining the cloud effect typically show small bias and fairly small scatter when compared to measurements (Koepke et al. 2006). To mention one example, Anders Lindfors et al. (2007) estimated daily erythemal UV doses at four Nordic stations, and found a systematic difference of between 0 and 4%, depending on the station, and a root-mean-square error of 5–9% as compared to measurements for the summer period.\nSatellite methods are based on radiative transfer simulations combined with information on, for example, clouds and total ozone column retrieved from the satellite observations. Satellite retrieved UV irradiances typically show an overestimation of 10% or more, and a large scatter, when compared to surface measurements: the root-mean-square errors for daily erythemal UV doses tends to be of the order of 30–40% (Kujanpää, Kalakoski, and Koskela 2010; Tanskanen et al. 2007; A. Lindfors et al. 2009). The main part of the overestimation is usually attributed to aerosol absorption, which is not accounted for properly in current satellite UV algorithms. The advantage of satellite methods, on the other hand, is their large geographical coverage, often global, and easy access to data that they provide.\nMost methods, both station-based UV reconstruction methods and satellite methods, only provide UV data corresponding to a selection of weighting functions (e.g., erythemally weighted ), and, in addition, sometimes irradiances for selected wavelengths. Furthermore, the methods typically include only irradiances for a horizontal surface. This may become an obstacle for biological applications where, for example, a specific weighting function or spectral information would be preferred. In principle, however, many of the methods could be extended to produce spectral irradiances and fluence rates. On the other hand, fluence rates can also be estimated based on the horizontal irradiance (e.g., Kylling et al. 2003).\nRecently, Anders Lindfors et al. (2009) presented a method for modelling spectral surface irradiances. The method relies on radiative transfer simulations, and takes as input (1) the effective cloud optical depth as inferred from pyranometer measurements of global:rad; (2) the total ozone column; (3) the surface albedo as estimated from measurements of snow depth; (4) the total water vapour column; and (5) the altitude of the location. Figure [fig:jok2001] shows a comparison between the daily accumulated irradiances at 300 and 320 nm from this method and measurements with a Brewer spectroradiometer at Jokioinen, southern Finland. At both wavelengths, the reconstructed irradiances closely follow the measured ones.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nA variety of methods for modelling the surface UV radiation are available. Which method is the best, or the most appropraite, depends on the specific question that is to be answered. In general, the complexity of the method tends to grow with increasing accuracy, and the pyranometer-based UV reconstruction methods, that are considered to provide highest accuracy, typically require an expert user. The use of such a method will, however, increase cross-disciplinary collaboration and may therefore be worthwhile.\n\n By ‘biologically effective irradiance’ we mean the irradiance weighted according to the effectiveness of different wavelengths in eliciting a photobiological response. The most frequently used biologically effective irradiance quantities are photometric quantities such as those described in Box [box:photometric:quantities] on page . In the case of photometric quantities the (energy) irradiance is weighted according to the response of the human eye.\nWhen studying the effects of radiation on plants we use as BSWFs (BSWFs) spectra describing the response of some plant function. For example an action spectrum for accumulation of flavonoids, or an action spectrum for growth inhibition. To be able to calculate biologically effective irradiances using any BSWF, we need to measure the spectral irradiance of the light source.\nIf we integrate the effective irradiance for the duration of an experiment then we obtain a biologically effective exposure (usually called ‘biologically effective dose’ by biologists). If we do the time integration for one day we obtain a biologically effective daily exposure.\nThese weighted irradiances are usually expressed using units corresponding to the underlying energy irradiances, independently of the BSWF used. Quantities calculated using different BSWFs are expressed in the same units, but the values cannot be compared because in reality they are measured on different scales.",

    "section": "4.10 BSWFs and effective UV doses",
    "text": "4.10 BSWFs and effective UV doses\nThe emission spectrum of UV-B lamps, even filtered with acetate, is different to that of the effect of ozone depletion. The spectrum of the effect of ozone depletion not only changes with ozone column thickness, but also with solar elevation. In other words, it changes through a day and with seasons (Figure [fig:lamp:solar:spectra]). Because of this, it is almost impossible to exactly simulate the effect of ozone depletion in field experiments. The best we can do is to calculate effective doses.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nBiologically effective exposures (see Box [ex:effective:irradiance]) are a way of measuring radiation differing in spectral composition with the same ‘measuring stick’. This ‘measuring stick’ is a biological response. Behind each measurement we need to assume the involvement of a biological response. If we know the action spectrum for the biological response, we can use it as a BSWF: We multiply, wavelength by wavelength the spectral irradiance of the light source by the BSWF obtaining a weighted spectrum, giving a biologically-effective spectral irradiance (Figure [fig:eff:spectral:irrad]). We then integrate the result over wavelengths, to obtain a single number, the biologically effective UV irradiance[^26]. In Figure [fig:eff:spectral:irrad] it also possible to appreciate the difference in relative change of this effective irradiance, for a given level of ozone depletion, depending on the BSWF used.\nIt is important to make sure that both the irradiance and the effectiveness are measured using compatible units. It is common to express action spectra as spectral quantum effectiveness and to measure light sources as spectral (energy) irradiance. In research, biologically effective doses are most frequently expressed in weighted energy units and to be able to calculate these doses from spectral (energy) irradiance measurements for a light source (sunlight or lamps) one needs to use an action spectrum expressed in energy effectiveness. Most common formulations of action spectra need to be transformed from quantum effectiveness to energy effectiveness (one important exception is the CIE erythemal spectrum formulation). This is something that is often neglected, and is a source of difficulties when comparing doses between different publications.\nAnother possibility for measuring effective doses is to have a broadband sensor with a spectral response resembling the action spectrum of interest. In practice the spectral response of such sensors is only an approximation to the desired and consequently need to be calibrated under the light source to be measured, usually by comparison to a double monochromator scanning spectroradiometer (see section 9.7 on page ). Most such sensors are calibrated for sunlight, and consequently give biased readings when used for measuring radiation from most lamps.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nThe RAF () gives the percent change in effective dose () or, strictly speaking, effective exposure () for each percent change in ozone column thickness. It should be calculated using logarithms. \\[\\mathrm{RAF} = \\frac{\\ln \\dose[d] - \\ln \\dose[n]}%\n        {\\ln [\\Chem{O_3}]^\\mathrm{n} - \\ln [\\Chem{O_3}]^\\mathrm{d}}\\] where is dose and \\([\\Chem{O_3}]\\) ozone concentration, and superscript \\(\\mathrm{d}\\) indicates ozone depleted condition, and superscript \\(\\mathrm{n}\\) indicates normal, or reference, ozone depth condition. The value of depends strongly on the action spectrum used to calculate the effective dose. Looking at fig. [fig:eff:spectral:irrad], it can be understood why is much larger for GEN than for PG.\n\n4.10.1 Weighting scales\nUltraviolet action spectra are usually normalized to quantum effectiveness = 1 at 300 nm. This is arbitrary, and especially in the older literature, you will find action spectra normalized at other wavelengths. In the Materials and Methods section always report the normalization used, in addition to the action spectrum used as a BSWF. Remember that as the wavelength used for normalization is arbitrary, values of effective UV doses calculated using the same BSWF but normalized at different wavelengths cannot be directly compared because they are expressed on different scales. Of course biologically effective irradiances based on different BSWFs cannot be compared to each other either.\nUsing the correct BSWF is very important, as using the wrong BSWF has usually serious implications on the interpretation of experimental results (Martyn M. Caldwell and Flint 2006; Kotilainen et al. 2011).\n\n\n4.10.2 Comparing lamps and solar radiation\nFrequently we want to compare UV doses in growth chambers to doses outdoors. Unless we have a solar simulator the spectra will differ significantly. It is especially important to keep the ratio similar to that in solar radiation. Table [tab:UVeff] gives an example comparing a frame with two acetate-filtered Q-Panel UVB-313 lamps to sunlight with normal and 20% depleted ozone at Jokioinen for 21 May at 11:30.\n\n\n4.10.3 Effective doses, enhancement errors and UV-B supplementation\nUltraviolet-radiation supplementation can be modulated so as to follow natural variation in solar UV or just follow a daily square wave pattern (see section 8.2.6 on page ). It is important that lamps are filtered with cellulose di-acetate film (to remove UV-C radiation emitted by UV-B lamps, which is absent in natural sunlight) and that these filters are replaced regularly, specially in the case of square wave systems, as modulated systems with feedback compensate for the reduced dose automatically (although not for the change in spectrum) (Newsham et al. 1996). Even when adequately filtered the emission spectrum of UV-B lamps does not match the effect of depletion (Figure [fig:weighted:lamp:depl:GPAS:PG]. We need to calculate effective doses using BSWFs.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nErrors caused by the mismatch between the doses aimed at and those achieved when simulating the effect of ozone depletion with UV-B enhancement with lamps are called enhancement errors. The main source of these errors is the mismatch between the assumed spectral response and the real spectral response. This is so because the adjustment of the burning time (or power) of the UV-B lamps used for enhancement needs to be based on biologically effective doses. However, depending on the different BSWFs used, the needed lamp burning time may be long or short (Figure [fig:lamp:burning:times]). Another way of looking at this problem is to compare the deviation of the achieved when using a ‘wrong’[^27] BSWF compared to the target one—e.g. corresponding to a certain magnitude of ozone depletion. Figure [fig:achieved:CIE] shows this comparison for the frequent case of use of a CIE-weighted broadband sensor to control the lamps used in experiments with plants. The errors are surprisingly small for GEN and PG.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nAn additional source of errors is shading by the lamp frames. If we do not attempt to compensate for the shade with UV-B from the lamps the error between PG and GEN is small (Kotilainen et al. 2011). How much the effective UV dose decreases with shading does not depend on the BSWF used as long as the shade is ‘gray’ (equally affects all relevant wavelengths). However, how much UV from the lamps will be needed to compensate for this will depend on the BSWF used (Table [tab:shading:errors]). With some BSWFs the lamp power or burning time needed to compensate for shading is much more than that needed to simulate ozone depletion, because with spectra like PG, we need to replace shaded UV-A with UV-B from lamps. See section [sec:RAF] on page for a discussion of the relationship between changes in ozone column and changes in effective UV radiation.\nTo minimize shading errors we must build lamp frames that produce little shade. Probably \\(&lt;\\!5\\)% shading is achievable. We should not attempt to compensate for shading by the frames with UV from lamps. Shifting the whole experiment’s UV baseline dose by a small percentage but keeping the size of enhancement at the target level is probably the best approach available.",

    "text": "4.11 Effective UV doses outdoors: seasonal and latitudinal variation\nThe state of the atmosphere (in terms of ozone column thickness, cloudiness and aerosol content) together with day-length and daily course of the solar zenith angle () are the main factors determining the climatology of (and its components, and ) at ground level. For clear sky conditions the average spatial and temporal distribution of UV irradiance can be computed by means of a radiative transfer model fed with proper and aerosol data (Grifoni et al. 2008, 2009). In these conditions the latitudinal and temporal distribution of irradiance are driven mainly by two factors: day-length and through the day. See section 9.9 on page for a discussion of different approaches to modelling.\nTo go from the climatology of spectral irradiance to that of the biologically effective () exposures (or doses), spectral irradiance has to be weighted to account for the different efficiency of each wavelength in producing biological effects; this is done applying a BSWF—based on the action spectrum of the biological process considered. Plant action spectra differ in the weight given to and radiation, as it has been illustrated in section 7.8 on page . In this analysis Grifoni et al. (2009) considered two action spectra related to plant response: the so-called Generalized Plant Action spectrum (GEN, proposed by M. M. Caldwell 1971) and the more recent Plant Growth spectrum (PG, S. D. Flint and Caldwell 2003). The erythemal action spectrum (CIE, McKinlay and Diffey 1987) was also included since instruments with a spectral sensibility quite close to it have been used in several field experiments. The analysis presented in this section was based on spectral global irradiance for cloud-free conditions on horizontal surfaces simulated by means of the STAR model (Ruggaber, Dlugi, and Nakajima 1994; Schwander et al. 2000) for Rome, Italy (lat. 41.88 N, long. 12.47 E), Potsdam, Germany (lat. 52.40 N, long. 13.03 E) and Trondheim, Norway (lat. 63.42 N, long. 10.42 E) on the first day of each month of the year from 1:00 to 23:00 (UTC time) with a 30 min time step. Daily doses () were calculated for all these 12 days.\nAfter convoluting the spectral energy irradiances at ground level for the three locations and seasons with the three BSWFs, a picture of the seasonal of radiation was obtained, which was different depending on latitude. The pattern of seasonal and latitudinal variation of the daily doses is shown to depend strongly on the BSWF, and day of the year (Table [tab:doses:seasons]).\nThe changes in daily doses occurring through the year relative to the yearly average, for the three locations across Europe illustrate the effect of action spectra used as BSWFs (Figure [fig:doses:seasonal]).\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nThe largest seasonal variation occurs when the daily doses are computed on the basis of action spectra completely or partially excluding the contribution of the component, as in the case of GEN and CIE respectively. Figure [fig:doses:seasonal] shows the extent to which latitude affects these seasonal changes, which have a larger amplitude as the latitude increases. In other words, the climatology of appears to be strongly dependent on the action spectrum used, and, as different plant responses follow different action spectra, the effective climatology will depend on the plant response under study.\nThese differences in climatology are ecologically relevant, for instance for perennial species that may experience different seasonal change in the irradiance they are exposed to, depending on the latitude at which they are growing and on the biological process/action spectrum studied.",

For example, if irradiance is much lower in daylight than in the controlled environment, but irradiance similar to that in daylight, the dose calculated using GEN(G) as a BSWF will differ little between the controlled environment and daylight, but the dose based on PG will be much lower in the controlled environment than in daylight. This example shows why we need to use a realistic light spectrum in controlled environments when we want to extrapolate the results from such experiments to natural conditions.

    "text": "4.13 An accuracy ranking of quantification methods\nTable [tab:methods:accuracy] shows a preliminary comparison of different methods available for quantifying solar UV radiation and estimating biologically effective doses. Bias is the systematic directional deviation from the true value, for example overestimation of irradiance or doses. Uncertainty is a random deviation that prevents us from knowing the true value, but deviations are not systematic —measurements from different instruments or the same instruments after different recalibrations will deviate by different amounts and in different directions from the true value.\nA detailed comparison is difficult with the information currently available, consequently some gaps remain in the table. However, some general recommendations are possible. For outdoors experiments with manipulation of solar , the best option is most probably a combination of (a) hourly simulation of UV spectral irradiance with a model using ground station data as input, plus (b) spot measurements, for example under different filters with a spectroradiometer under clear sky conditions. It is best to replace modelling (a) with actual continuous measurements with a well calibrated double monochromator spectroradiometer. However, this is rarely possible in practice, as there are few ground stations producing validated spectral data.\nFor experiments using lamps, the best option from the point of view of accuracy is the use of a double monochromator spectroradiometer. From a practical viewpoint, using a broadband instrument calibrated against a double monochromator spectroradiometer, may be easier. When measuring mixed daylight and lamp radiation, or mixed radiation from diverse lamps, or when there is degradation of filters, broadband instruments are totally unsuitable.\nSingle monochromator spectroradiometers should be avoided for measurements of radiation when there is a background of or visible radiation, unless very special handling of stray light is done by a combination of special measuring protocols and data processing.",

See sections 8.6.1 and 8.6.2 for recommendations on manipulation of radiation, section 10.9 for recommendations about plant growing conditions, and section 11.12 for recommendations about statistical design of experiments.\n\nAlways report in your publications the radiation effective exposure (frequently called effective doses in the biological literature), depending on the type of experiment, as daily integrated values or effective irradiances plus daily exposure time. Calculate effective doses using relevant action spectra and if possible report doses using all the most commonly used ones: CIE, GEN(G), and PG.\nAlways indicate the name of the quantity measured, the type of sensor and its position during measurement, location of sensor with reference to plants, and unit of measurement. In the case of effective doses, indicate how they were calculated, in particular, cite the bibliographic source for the action spectrum and formulation used, and at which wavelength the spectrum was normalized to effectiveness equal to unity.\nWhenever possible include in your publications the emission spectrum of the light source and/or transmittance spectrum of the filters used, or cite an earlier paper where the spectra have already been published.\nUse only instruments with recent and valid calibration data for the measurements at hand.\nMake sure, in the case of broadband sensors, that the calibration is valid for the light source being measured. For example, broadband sensors calibrated for sunlight should not be used for measuring irradiance under lamps.\nIf high precision is required in the measurements, apply all the necessary corrections. This is important both for broadband and spectral measurements.\nBe aware of temperature effects on the functioning of the meter and sensor used and apply the required corrections or use temperature stabilized instruments.\nSingle monochromator array or scanning spectrometers can be used for measuring effective exposures in sunlight only with very serious limitations and only if complicated corrections are applied to the raw data to take into account stray light and the properties of the slit function. These corrections are not possible with the software provided by the makers of the instruments. Uncorrected measurements from this type of instruments are subject to huge uncertainties and, what is worse, bias. Use double monochromator spectroradiometers instead.\nWhen using spectrometers configured with SMA connectors for optical fibres, do not detach the fibre at the spectrometer end[^28][^29]. Doing so invalidates the calibration because the alignment of the fibre with respect to the entrance slit may be different after the fibre is reattached.\nWhen measuring, take into account the field of view of the entrance optics of your instrument (e.g. one hemisphere for a cosine corrected irradiance sensor) and make sure that yourself and any other nearby objects do not disturb the radiation ‘seen’ by the instrument.\nTake into account that spot measurements of in sunlight under different filters describe only one point in time. Continuous measurements or modelling based on continuous ground-based measurements are needed to fully describe the treatments applied.\nOutdoor irradiance is affected by cloudiness, so measurements where a single instrument is moved to take sequential measurements under the different treatments should be avoided unless the sky is perfectly clear. In addition, parallel measurement of PAR or global radiation in the open is recommended so as to be able to detect any variation due to clouds.\nexposure values (also called doses) derived from satellite-based measurements are subject to relatively large errors and bias, so it is better to avoid their use, specially when daily or weekly values are needed. Much of the uncertainty derives from the sparse nature of the satellite data (e.g. one or fewer fly overs per day).\nRoutinely check your instruments. Frequently check that the readings are very close to zero when the sensor is in darkness. Do sanity checks on your data against values expected (e.g. using models or published data). For example if when measuring a sunlight spectrum you get spectral irradiance values different from zero[^30] at wavelengths shorter than 290 nm you can be sure that there is a problem. There may be too much stray light, or a bad correction for the dark signal, or simply the spectrometer is not good enough for the job.\nWhen measuring sunlight or lamp spectra for calculating effective doses you need a spectroradiometer with a spectral resolution of at least 1 nm. Furthermore to reduce noise use only averaging of repeated scans rather than ‘Boxcar smoothing’. Boxcar smoothing reduces the spectral resolution by doing a moving average across wavelengths.",

    "section": "4.17 Appendix: Formulations for action spectra used as BSWFs",
    "text": "4.17 Appendix: Formulations for action spectra used as BSWFs\nThe calculation of biologically effective UV doses requires weighting the spectral energy irradiance () or spectral photon irradiance () at each wavelength with a weighting value that is typically generated from a mathematical formulation fitted to describe the weighting function or action spectrum of the biological process—i.e. a BSWF (BSWF). Data obtained from a spectroradiometer are usually provided as spectral energy irradiance (units: ) and care should be taken to use the appropriate formulation that uses either energy effectiveness () or quantum effectiveness () values as appropriate.\nThe usual approach is to base effective UV doses on energy irradiance data, using BSWFs that provide values for relative energy effectiveness at each wavelength. However, BSWFs are often defined using quantum effectiveness for application to photon irradiance values. Consequently, conversion of energy irradiance values measured during experiments to photon irradiance is necessary before applying weighting functions originally formulated using quantum effectiveness. Conversion of energy irradiance values to photon irradiance can be achieved using equation [eq:photon] on page . After conversion, the calculated effective doses will be on a different scale than if they are calculated based on energy irradiance values. Note that you may find examples in the literature where formulations based on quantum effectiveness () have been inappropriately applied to spectral energy exposure (unit: ) or spectral energy irradiance (unit: ).\nThe general plant action spectrum of Caldwell (Code GEN in Table [tab:action:spectra] on page ) was originally published simply as a graphical figure of quantum effectiveness against wavelength (M. M. Caldwell 1971) and subsequently two publications have fitted different mathematical formulations to describe its use as a weighting function. Green, Sawada, and Shettle (1974) fitted a function that decreases to zero at 313 nm whereas an alternative mathematical fit provided by Thimijan, Carns, and Campbell (1978) continues to weight irradiance values up to 345 nm in the region. Both of these functions are shown on Figure [fig:action:spectra] on page as GEN(G) and GEN(T) respectively. It is important to specify which mathematical function has been used when describing the calculation of effective UV doses in experimental methods.\nThe general plant action spectrum of Caldwell fitted with the mathematical function of Green, Sawada, and Shettle (1974) is given by (Source: L. O. Björn and Teramura 1993):\n\\[\\qeff[GEN(G)](\\lambda) = \\begin{cases}\n           2.618 \\cdot \\left[ 1-\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{313.3}\\right)^2 \\right] \\cdot %\\cr\n\\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{\\lambda-300}{31.08}} & \\text{if $\\lambda\\le313.3$ nm}\\\\\n0 & \\text{if $\\lambda&gt;313.3$ nm}\n\\end{cases} \\label{eq:GEN.G}\\]\nand when fitted with the mathematical function of Thimijan, Carns, and Campbell (1978) is given by (Source: L. O. Björn and Teramura 1993):\n\\[\\qeff[GEN(T)](\\lambda) = \\begin{cases}\n\\mathrm{e}^{-\\left(\\frac{265-\\lambda}{21}\\right)^2} & \\text{if $\\lambda\\le345$ nm}\\\\\n0 & \\text{if $\\lambda&gt;345$ nm}\n\\end{cases} \\label{eq:GEN.T}\\]\nThe DNA damage formulation of Green and Miller (1975) is given by:\n\\[%\\qeff[DNA(GM)](\\lambda) & = & \\exp\\left\\{ 13.82 \\cdot \\left[ \\left( 1+\\exp\\left( \\frac{\\lambda-310}{9} \\right)\\right)^{-1} -1 \\right] \\right\\} \\label{eq:DNA.GM}\n\\qeff[DNA(GM)](\\lambda) = \\mathrm{e}^{ 13.82 \\cdot \\left[ \\left( 1+\\mathrm{e}^{ \\frac{\\lambda-310}{9}} \\right)^{-1} -1 \\right] } \\label{eq:DNA.GM}\\]\nThe doses calculated with this formulation differ significantly from doses calculated using tabulated values derived from the figure in Setlow (1974). For example the model TUV and the data from the NSF monitoring network use the tabulated values rather than the formulation by Green and Miller (1975).\nHowever, most BSWFs are conventionally used with a value of one at 300 nm. This may be achieved by simple calculation adjustments within a spreadsheet (by dividing each wavelength effectiveness by the effectiveness value at 300 nm) or by altering the mathematical formula directly. Thus, the mathematical formulation of Green, Sawada, and Shettle (1974) for GEN(G) requires equation [eq:GEN.G] to be multiplied by 4.596 to normalize it to a value of 1 at 300nm and similarly GEN(T) requires equation [eq:GEN.T] to be multiplied by 16.083 and DNA(GM) requires equation [eq:DNA.GM] to be multiplied by 30.675.\nThe formulation of the weighting function published by S. D. Flint and Caldwell (2003) for plant growth, shown as PG in Figure [fig:action:spectra] on page , was for quantum effectiveness and already provides normalization to 1 at 300 nm and is given by:\n\\[%\\qeff[PG](\\lambda) & = & \\cases{\\mathrm{e}^{4.688272\\ \\cdot\n% \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{e}^{0.1703411 \\cdot \\frac{\\lambda-307.867}{1.15} +\n%\\left(\\frac{390-\\lambda}{121.7557}-4.183832\\right)}}} & if $\\lambda\\le390$ nm\\cr\n%0 & if $\\lambda&gt;390$ nm\\cr} \\label{eq:PG}\n\\qeff[PG](\\lambda) =  \\begin{cases}\\exp\\left(4.688272\\ \\cdot \\right. \\cr\n\\left.\n\\ \\ \\ \\exp\\left(-\\exp\\left(0.1703411 \\cdot \\frac{\\lambda-307.867}{1.15}\\right)\\right) + \\right. %\\cr\n\\left.\n\\left(\\frac{390-\\lambda}{121.7557}-4.183832\\right)\\right) & \\text{if $\\lambda\\le390$ nm}\\\\\n0 & \\text{if $\\lambda&gt;390$ nm}\n\\end{cases}\n\\label{eq:PG}\\]\nSome weighting functions are already defined using energy effectiveness values for use with energy irradiance data, one example being the CIE erythemal action spectrum (McKinlay and Diffey 1987; A. R. Webb et al. 2011). The standard was revised in 1998 and the updated version should be used instead of the original one from 1987 (A. R. Webb et al. 2011). It is important to check that published mathematical formulae have been appropriately normalized to one at 300 nm. However, whereas most BSWFs are conventionally set to one at 300 nm, the CIE98 erythemal weighting function has defined values at specific wavelengths (A. R. Webb et al. 2011) and is given by:\n\\[\\eeff[CIE](\\lambda) = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if $250\\le\\lambda\\le298$ nm}\\\\\n10^{0.094(298-\\lambda)} & \\text{if $298\\le\\lambda\\le328$ nm}\\\\\n10^{0.015(140-\\lambda)} & \\text{if $328\\le\\lambda\\le400$ nm}\\\\\n0 & \\text{if $\\lambda &gt; 400$}\n\\end{cases} \\label{eq:CIE}\\]\nWeighting functions defined using quantum effectiveness (), and normalized to one at 300 nm, can be converted to relative energy effectiveness () simply by multiplication, wavelength by wavelength, of the quantum effectiveness by by the respective wavelength in nm and dividing by 300 (the chosen normalization wavelength in nm). The value 300 should be changed when using other wavelengths for normalization. This is based on equation [eq:photon] giving the energy in one photon, but as Planck’s constant (\\(h\\)) and the speed of light in vacuum (\\(c\\)) are constant divisors, and we are expressing the effectiveness in relative units, they can be left out of the calculation.\nIt is always essential to specify clearly the normalization wavelength, the mathematical formulation and the BSWF used when describing the calculation of effective UV doses.\n\n2\n\n4.18 Appendix: Calculation of effective doses with Excel\nLet us start with a text file generated by a spectroradiometer and its connected computer. With the instruments that I have used this text file consists of one column, containing either spectral (energy) irradiance or spectral photon irradiance (some instruments, especially for underwater use, may have fluence rate instead of irradiance). At the start, above the columns, is a heading containing supplementary information. Other instruments may have two columns, the first one containing wavelength values, the other one spectral irradiance values.\nFor the Optronics instruments that I have used, the start of a data file looks like the listing in Figure [fig:list:Optronics]. The heading here contains “a”, which in this case is the name of the file, the kind of data that is recorded (including the unit), the date, the starting wavelength in nm, the end wavelength (not shown here) in nm, and the step interval in nm. This file can be loaded into an Excel file going to Data\\(&gt;\\)Get external data\\(&gt;\\)Load text file. When you have done this, insert a new column to the left of the one containing the measured data. In this new column you should fill in the wavelength values, which can be done in the following way without typing every value:\n\n\n\"a\",\"Irradiance [W/(cm^2 nm)]\",971217,250.00,400.00,1.00\n1.439562E-010\n1.797497E-010\n6.126532E-010\n4.516362E-009\n8.027722E-009\n1.081851E-009\n2.862175E-010\n1.728253E-010\n1.790998E-010\n1.953554E-010\n2.570309E-010\n...\n\n\nType the first two values, i.e. in this case first “250” in the cell left of the one containing the first radiation value 1.439562E-010. Since the step interval is 1.00 nm, the next value is 251. Type this in the cell to the left of the value 1.797497E-010. Select the two cells that you have just filled in. Put the cursor at the lower left corner of the cell containing “251” and see it change appearance, push the (left) mouse button and drag down to the cell left of the last radiation value. The column will then fill up with the appropriate wavelength values.\nYou have now filled columns A and B with the appropriate values. Next you should generate a column with values of the weighting function. Suppose you wish to use the weighting function of S. D. Flint and Caldwell (2003). The formula given for this in the publication is Biologically effective UV= \\(\\exp[4.688272*\\exp(- \\exp(0.1703411*(x-307.867)/1.15))+((390-x)/121.7557-4.183832)]\\) in which \\(x\\) stands for wavelength in nm.\nSelect cells in column C over the rows corresponding to values in columns A and B. Go to “Tools” on top of the file, push the mouse button and go down and select “Calculator”. Type the formula above, with the exceptions that you use ordinary parentheses instead of square brackets, “A:A” instead of “x” (do not type the quotation marks), and comma instead of dot if you use the comma system. When this is done, press OK and save the result.\nYou now have the values of the weighting function in column C. If you double-click on the first value in column C you should get the equation entered. The top of your file should then look like Figure [fig:Excel:sheet]. If you insert a new column C to the left of your old column C and copy the wavelength values into it you can plot your weighting function as a check. If you plot it on a logarithmic abscissa, it should look something like Figure [fig:Excel:PG]. This can be compared to the plot in the original publication by S. D. Flint and Caldwell (2003). Once you have generated a weighting function that you wish to use several times, you need of course not calculate it like this every time. You can simply transfer the column with it to a new sheet or a new Excel file. Since, as newly generated, it depends on another column, you need to use the command “Paste special” and choose “values”.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nNow you are ready to do the weighting itself. Select cells in column E in rows corresponding to the values in the other columns. Select the Calculator, and use it to multiply values in column B with the weighting function. Select an empty cell and go a final time to the Calculator. Select “Sum” and then the values you have just generated in column E. The sum you get in the cell you selected is the weighted radiation value. The number is, in this case, 0.000334759 and the unit is W cm\\(^{-2}\\), which can also be expressed as 3.35 . The bottom of the file should look like Figure [fig:Excel:sheet:bottom]. I have written \\(\\Sigma\\) in one cell to remember that the value to the right of it is the sum of the values above it.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nNote that if you have another step size than 1 nm, you must multiply the sum by that step size. It is recommended that you do not use step sizes greater than 1 nm for UV-B spectra, since both the spectra themselves and the weighting functions are so steep.\nMartyn Caldwell’s traditional Generalized Plant Action Spectrum is easier to handle, and you should be able now to do a similar exercise with it yourself. A formula for this weighting function has been published by Green, Sawada, and Shettle (1974): Weighting function \\(= 2.618\\cdot[1 -( \\lambda/313.3)2]\\cdot \\exp[-(\\lambda - 300)/31.08],\\) where \\(\\lambda\\) stands for wavelength in nm. We abbreviate the name of this action spectrum as GEN(G) elsewhere in this text. See section 9.17 on page for the equations for other commonly used BSWFs.\n\n\n4.19 Appendix: Calculation of effective doses with R\n\n4.19.1 Introduction\nIf you use the R system for statistics (see, http://www.r-project.org/), or if you need an implementation with fewer restrictions, you may want to use R instead of Excel to calculate doses and action spectra. R is based on a real programming language called S and allows much flexibility. We have developed a package to facilitate these calculations. The package is called ‘UVcalc’ and will be soon submitted to CRAN (Comprehensive R archive network) and will be available also from this handbook’s web page. In addition to functions for calculating weighted and unweighted doses, and irradiance and from energy irradiance spectra, also functions for calculating photon ratios are provided.\n\n\n4.19.2 Calculating doses\nCurrently functions for five are implemented and are listed in Table [tab:R:dose:functions]. The functions take two arguments one vector giving the wavelengths and another vector giving the values of spectral energy irradiance at these wavelengths. The spectral irradiance or spectral exposure values would come either from measurements with a spectroradiometer or from model simulations. All functions accept a wavelengths vector with variable and arbitrary step sizes, with the condition that the wavelengths are sorted in strictly increasing order, something which is especially convenient when dealing with data from array spectrometers[^31].\nThe functions are made available by installing the package UVcalc (once) and loading it from the library when needed. To load the package into the workspace use library(UVcalc). Then load your spectral data into R using read.table() or read.csv().\nA file from a Macam spectroradiometer starts:\nWavelength(nm),W/m2\n270,0\n271,0\n272,1.17E-04\n273,2.42E-04\n274,4.55E-04\n275,8.94E-04\n276,0.00161\n277,0.00263\n278,0.00412\n279,0.00621\n280,0.00904\n281,0.01697\n282,0.02069\n283,0.02663\n284,0.03314\n285,0.04075\n286,0.04895\n287,0.05817\n288,0.0679\nFor a file like this one, use the code below but replacing \"name\" with the name and path to the data file. On Windows systems you need to scape backslashes in file paths like this: ‘\\\\’.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nIf our spectral irradiance data is in , and the wavelength in nm, as in the case of the Macam spectroradiometer, the functions will return the effective irradiance in .\nIf, for example, the spectral irradiance output by our model or spectroradiometer is in m, and the wavelengths are in Ångstrom then to obtain the effective irradiance in we will need to convert the units.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nIn this example, we take advantage of the behaviour of the S language: an operation between a scalar and vector, is equivalent to applying this operation to each member of the vector. Consequently, in the code above, each value from the vector of wavelengths is divided by 10, and each value in the vector of spectral irradiances is divided by 1000.\nIf the spectral irradiance is in then values should be multiplied by 10 to convert them to .\nIt is very important to make sure that the wavelengths are in nanometers as this is what the functions expect. If the wavelengths are in the wrong units, the BSWF will be wrongly calculated, and the returned value for effective irradiance will be wrong.\nIf we use as input to the functions instead of spectral irradiances, time-integrated spectral irradiances in , then the functions will return the effective exposure, or ‘dose’ in . Such time-integrated values are more frequently available as the output of models, or by integrating observed sequential values of spectral irradiance.\nIn addition to the functions for calculating biologically effective doses and effective irradiances, we provide functions for calculating unweighted doses or irradiances of (PPFD() or PAR.q.dose(), and PAR.e.dose()), (UVA.q.dose() and UVA.e.dose()) and (UVB.q.dose() and UVB.e.dose()), where ‘e’ variants return energy doses, and ‘q’ variants return quantum or photon doses. All functions expect as input radiation spectra in energy units, and wavelengths in nm.\n\n\n4.19.3 Calculating an action spectrum at given wavelengths\nThe functions available for calculating action spectra take as argument a vector of wavelengths, and return a vector of effectiveness (either quantum=photon or energy based) normalized to unity effectiveness at a wavelength of 300 nm except when indicated. These functions are listed in Table [tab:R:action:spectra:functions], and an example of their use follows. In these examples we generate the wavelengths vectors in R, but they can be also read from a file.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nAll functions accept a wavelengths vector with variable and arbitrary step sizes, with the condition that the wavelengths are sorted in strictly increasing order.\n\n\n4.19.4 Calculating photon ratios\nFunctions are also provided for calculating photon ratios between different pairs of wavebands. These functions are listed in Table [tab:R:photon:ratios:functions]. We follow the most frequently used wavelength ranges for the different colours, but also provide some generic functions that can be used when other limits are needed. Continuing with the example above in which my.data was read and attached we calculate UV-B : PAR photon ratio\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nThe spectral energy irradiance, can be in any energy based unit such as , or , as the multipliers cancel out when calculating the ratio. However, wavelengths must be always expressed in nanometers. Please, be aware that these functions will return erroneous values if used with spectra expressed as spectral photon irradiance, even though the returned values are photon ratios.\nPlease, be aware that following common practice in the literature, the wavelength range used for red light is different for the different photon ratios.\n\n\n4.19.5 Documentation\nThe package includes manual pages for the different functions, and an overview and a list of references for the original sources used. The definition of the functions can bee seen once the package is loaded by entering the name of the function without parameters or parentheses.\nThere are many resources on the R-System for Statistics and statistics in general available on-line. The most useful ones are The R Wiki (http://rwiki.sciviews.org/), and the documentation included in all R installations and accompanying each one of the different packages.\nSome classical books on R are those by Dalgaard (2002), Crawley (2005, 2007), and William N. Venables and Ripley (2002). The book by (W. N. Venables and Ripley 2000) discusses programming in S, the language used in R to build new functions and packages.\n\n\n\n4.20 Appendix: Suppliers of instruments\nIn this section we provide names and web addresses to some suppliers of instruments.

    "text": "4.18 Appendix: Calculation of effective doses with Excel\nLet us start with a text file generated by a spectroradiometer and its connected computer. With the instruments that I have used this text file consists of one column, containing either spectral (energy) irradiance or spectral photon irradiance (some instruments, especially for underwater use, may have fluence rate instead of irradiance). At the start, above the columns, is a heading containing supplementary information. Other instruments may have two columns, the first one containing wavelength values, the other one spectral irradiance values.\nFor the Optronics instruments that I have used, the start of a data file looks like the listing in Figure [fig:list:Optronics]. The heading here contains “a”, which in this case is the name of the file, the kind of data that is recorded (including the unit), the date, the starting wavelength in nm, the end wavelength (not shown here) in nm, and the step interval in nm. This file can be loaded into an Excel file going to Data\\(&gt;\\)Get external data\\(&gt;\\)Load text file. When you have done this, insert a new column to the left of the one containing the measured data. In this new column you should fill in the wavelength values, which can be done in the following way without typing every value:\n\n\n\"a\",\"Irradiance [W/(cm^2 nm)]\",971217,250.00,400.00,1.00\n1.439562E-010\n1.797497E-010\n6.126532E-010\n4.516362E-009\n8.027722E-009\n1.081851E-009\n2.862175E-010\n1.728253E-010\n1.790998E-010\n1.953554E-010\n2.570309E-010\n...\n\n\nType the first two values, i.e. in this case first “250” in the cell left of the one containing the first radiation value 1.439562E-010. Since the step interval is 1.00 nm, the next value is 251. Type this in the cell to the left of the value 1.797497E-010. Select the two cells that you have just filled in. Put the cursor at the lower left corner of the cell containing “251” and see it change appearance, push the (left) mouse button and drag down to the cell left of the last radiation value. The column will then fill up with the appropriate wavelength values.\nYou have now filled columns A and B with the appropriate values. Next you should generate a column with values of the weighting function. Suppose you wish to use the weighting function of S. D. Flint and Caldwell (2003). The formula given for this in the publication is Biologically effective UV= \\(\\exp[4.688272*\\exp(- \\exp(0.1703411*(x-307.867)/1.15))+((390-x)/121.7557-4.183832)]\\) in which \\(x\\) stands for wavelength in nm.\nSelect cells in column C over the rows corresponding to values in columns A and B. Go to “Tools” on top of the file, push the mouse button and go down and select “Calculator”. Type the formula above, with the exceptions that you use ordinary parentheses instead of square brackets, “A:A” instead of “x” (do not type the quotation marks), and comma instead of dot if you use the comma system. When this is done, press OK and save the result.\nYou now have the values of the weighting function in column C. If you double-click on the first value in column C you should get the equation entered. The top of your file should then look like Figure [fig:Excel:sheet]. If you insert a new column C to the left of your old column C and copy the wavelength values into it you can plot your weighting function as a check. If you plot it on a logarithmic abscissa, it should look something like Figure [fig:Excel:PG]. This can be compared to the plot in the original publication by S. D. Flint and Caldwell (2003). Once you have generated a weighting function that you wish to use several times, you need of course not calculate it like this every time. You can simply transfer the column with it to a new sheet or a new Excel file. Since, as newly generated, it depends on another column, you need to use the command “Paste special” and choose “values”.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nNow you are ready to do the weighting itself. Select cells in column E in rows corresponding to the values in the other columns. Select the Calculator, and use it to multiply values in column B with the weighting function. Select an empty cell and go a final time to the Calculator. Select “Sum” and then the values you have just generated in column E. The sum you get in the cell you selected is the weighted radiation value. The number is, in this case, 0.000334759 and the unit is W cm\\(^{-2}\\), which can also be expressed as 3.35 . The bottom of the file should look like Figure [fig:Excel:sheet:bottom]. I have written \\(\\Sigma\\) in one cell to remember that the value to the right of it is the sum of the values above it.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nNote that if you have another step size than 1 nm, you must multiply the sum by that step size. It is recommended that you do not use step sizes greater than 1 nm for UV-B spectra, since both the spectra themselves and the weighting functions are so steep.\nMartyn Caldwell’s traditional Generalized Plant Action Spectrum is easier to handle, and you should be able now to do a similar exercise with it yourself. A formula for this weighting function has been published by Green, Sawada, and Shettle (1974): Weighting function \\(= 2.618\\cdot[1 -( \\lambda/313.3)2]\\cdot \\exp[-(\\lambda - 300)/31.08],\\) where \\(\\lambda\\) stands for wavelength in nm. We abbreviate the name of this action spectrum as GEN(G) elsewhere in this text. See section 9.17 on page for the equations for other commonly used BSWFs.",

    "section": "4.19 Appendix: Calculation of effective doses with R",
    "text": "4.19 Appendix: Calculation of effective doses with R\n\n4.19.1 Introduction\nIf you use the R system for statistics (see, http://www.r-project.org/), or if you need an implementation with fewer restrictions, you may want to use R instead of Excel to calculate doses and action spectra. R is based on a real programming language called S and allows much flexibility. We have developed a package to facilitate these calculations. The package is called ‘UVcalc’ and will be soon submitted to CRAN (Comprehensive R archive network) and will be available also from this handbook’s web page. In addition to functions for calculating weighted and unweighted doses, and irradiance and from energy irradiance spectra, also functions for calculating photon ratios are provided.\n\n\n4.19.2 Calculating doses\nCurrently functions for five are implemented and are listed in Table [tab:R:dose:functions]. The functions take two arguments one vector giving the wavelengths and another vector giving the values of spectral energy irradiance at these wavelengths. The spectral irradiance or spectral exposure values would come either from measurements with a spectroradiometer or from model simulations. All functions accept a wavelengths vector with variable and arbitrary step sizes, with the condition that the wavelengths are sorted in strictly increasing order, something which is especially convenient when dealing with data from array spectrometers[^31].\nThe functions are made available by installing the package UVcalc (once) and loading it from the library when needed. To load the package into the workspace use library(UVcalc). Then load your spectral data into R using read.table() or read.csv().\nA file from a Macam spectroradiometer starts:\nWavelength(nm),W/m2\n270,0\n271,0\n272,1.17E-04\n273,2.42E-04\n274,4.55E-04\n275,8.94E-04\n276,0.00161\n277,0.00263\n278,0.00412\n279,0.00621\n280,0.00904\n281,0.01697\n282,0.02069\n283,0.02663\n284,0.03314\n285,0.04075\n286,0.04895\n287,0.05817\n288,0.0679\nFor a file like this one, use the code below but replacing \"name\" with the name and path to the data file. On Windows systems you need to scape backslashes in file paths like this: ‘\\\\’.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nIf our spectral irradiance data is in , and the wavelength in nm, as in the case of the Macam spectroradiometer, the functions will return the effective irradiance in .\nIf, for example, the spectral irradiance output by our model or spectroradiometer is in m, and the wavelengths are in Ångstrom then to obtain the effective irradiance in we will need to convert the units.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nIn this example, we take advantage of the behaviour of the S language: an operation between a scalar and vector, is equivalent to applying this operation to each member of the vector. Consequently, in the code above, each value from the vector of wavelengths is divided by 10, and each value in the vector of spectral irradiances is divided by 1000.\nIf the spectral irradiance is in then values should be multiplied by 10 to convert them to .\nIt is very important to make sure that the wavelengths are in nanometers as this is what the functions expect. If the wavelengths are in the wrong units, the BSWF will be wrongly calculated, and the returned value for effective irradiance will be wrong.\nIf we use as input to the functions instead of spectral irradiances, time-integrated spectral irradiances in , then the functions will return the effective exposure, or ‘dose’ in . Such time-integrated values are more frequently available as the output of models, or by integrating observed sequential values of spectral irradiance.\nIn addition to the functions for calculating biologically effective doses and effective irradiances, we provide functions for calculating unweighted doses or irradiances of (PPFD() or PAR.q.dose(), and PAR.e.dose()), (UVA.q.dose() and UVA.e.dose()) and (UVB.q.dose() and UVB.e.dose()), where ‘e’ variants return energy doses, and ‘q’ variants return quantum or photon doses. All functions expect as input radiation spectra in energy units, and wavelengths in nm.\n\n\n4.19.3 Calculating an action spectrum at given wavelengths\nThe functions available for calculating action spectra take as argument a vector of wavelengths, and return a vector of effectiveness (either quantum=photon or energy based) normalized to unity effectiveness at a wavelength of 300 nm except when indicated. These functions are listed in Table [tab:R:action:spectra:functions], and an example of their use follows. In these examples we generate the wavelengths vectors in R, but they can be also read from a file.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nAll functions accept a wavelengths vector with variable and arbitrary step sizes, with the condition that the wavelengths are sorted in strictly increasing order.\n\n\n4.19.4 Calculating photon ratios\nFunctions are also provided for calculating photon ratios between different pairs of wavebands. These functions are listed in Table [tab:R:photon:ratios:functions]. We follow the most frequently used wavelength ranges for the different colours, but also provide some generic functions that can be used when other limits are needed. Continuing with the example above in which my.data was read and attached we calculate UV-B : PAR photon ratio\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nThe spectral energy irradiance, can be in any energy based unit such as , or , as the multipliers cancel out when calculating the ratio. However, wavelengths must be always expressed in nanometers. Please, be aware that these functions will return erroneous values if used with spectra expressed as spectral photon irradiance, even though the returned values are photon ratios.\nPlease, be aware that following common practice in the literature, the wavelength range used for red light is different for the different photon ratios.\n\n\n4.19.5 Documentation\nThe package includes manual pages for the different functions, and an overview and a list of references for the original sources used. The definition of the functions can bee seen once the package is loaded by entering the name of the function without parameters or parentheses.\nThere are many resources on the R-System for Statistics and statistics in general available on-line. The most useful ones are The R Wiki (http://rwiki.sciviews.org/), and the documentation included in all R installations and accompanying each one of the different packages.\nSome classical books on R are those by Dalgaard (2002), Crawley (2005, 2007), and William N. Venables and Ripley (2002). The book by (W. N. Venables and Ripley 2000) discusses programming in S, the language used in R to build new functions and packages.",
