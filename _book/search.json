    "text": "Acknowledgements\nIn this handbook we discuss methods relevant to research on the responses of plants to ultraviolet () radiation. We also summarize the knowledge needed to make informed decisions about manipulation and quantification of radiation, and the design of experiments. We give guidelines and practical recommendations for obtaining reliable and relevant data and interpretations. We cover research both on terrestrial and aquatic plants (seaweeds, marine angiosperms and freshwater higher plants are included, but microalgae are excluded from the scope of this work). We consider experimentation on ecological, eco-physiological and physiological questions.\nThe handbook will be most useful to early stage researchers (ESRs). However, more experienced researchers will also find information of interest. The guidelines themselves, we hope, will ensure a high and uniform standard of quality for research within our COST action, and the whole research community. We have written this text so that it is useful both for reading from cover to cover and for reference. It will also be useful as a textbook for training workshops aimed at ESRs.\nPhysiological and eco-physiological experiments can attempt to respond to different objective questions: (1) will a future increase in radiation affect growth and morphology of plants? (2) what is the effect of current radiation levels on plant growth and morphology? (3) what are the mechanisms by which plants respond to radiation? Ecological experiments can have other objectives, e.g. (1) does radiation in sunlight affect plant fitness? (2) does a differential effect of radiation between plant species affect the outcome of competition? (3) does the exposure to radiation alter plant-pathogen and plant-herbivore interactions? Finally applied research related to agricultural and horticultural production and produce is based on questions like: (1) can manipulations of radiation be used to manage produce quality? (2) can manipulation of radiation replace the use of pesticides and growth regulators? The approach suitable for a given experiment will depend on its objectives.\nWhen doing experiments with terrestrial plants, the medium surrounding the stems and leaves is air. At short path lengths air has little influence on irradiance and only when considering the whole depth of the atmosphere, its transmittance needs to be taken into account. In contrast, water and impurities like dissolved organic matter (DOM) absorb radiation over relatively short path lengths, which means that in water bodies irradiance decreases with depth. Basic concepts of photobiology, radiation physics and in the natural environment of plants are discussed in chapter 7.\nVaried approaches are used in the study of the effects of radition on plants. The main dichotomy is whether (1) radiation is added by means of special lamps to either sunlight or to visible light from other lamps, or (2) radiation in sunlight is excluded or attenuated by means of filters. Both approaches are extensively discussed in chapter 8.\nFor any experimental approach used in research we need to quantify radiation and express it as meaningful physical quantities that allow comparison among experiments and to natural conditions. When comparing irradiance from sources differing in spectral composition, the comparison requires the calculation of biologically effective doses. Quantification of radiation is discussed in chapter 9. The appendices present in detail the calculations needed when measuring action spectra, and for calculating biologically effective doses both with Excel and R. An R package which facilitates such calculations accompanies this handbook, and will be made available through CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network) and the handbook’s web pages at http://uv4growth.dyndns.org.\nBoth for terrestrial and aquatic plants the enclosing materials should be carefully chosen based on their transmittance and reflectance properties. This is crucial in research, but also in any other research with plants using an enclosing structure such as open-top chambers (OTC), greenhouses or aquaria. These and many other considerations about the cultivation of plants are discussed in chapter 10.\nOnly experiments well designed from the statistical point of view, allow valid conclusions to be reached. In addition a valid statistical analysis of the data, consistent with the design of the experiment and based on as few assumptions as possible, is required. Well designed experiments are also efficient in the use of resources (both time and money). The design of experiments and the analysis of the data obtained are discussed in chapter 11.\nFinally a few words about terminology. As the same quantities and units are used for measuring visible, and ultraviolet radiation, throughout the book we use the word “radiation” to refer to both visible and ultraviolet radiation. We prefer “radiation” to “light”, since light is sometimes, but not always, used for just the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum visible to humans.\nIn the PDF file all links and crossreferences are ‘live’: just click on them to navigate through the file.

This book is a collaborative effort of all members of the technical group on technology of this action, plus four authors not participating in the Action. The first conference and workshop organized by the Action in Szeged, Hungary, put the authors in contact as well as allowing them to realise that a book on research methods was needed. Some of the authors met again in Denmark, and spent two and a half days of intense writing and discussions thanks to the hospitality of Eva Rosenqvist and Carl-Otto Ottosen. We thank Profs. Åke Strid and Donat Häder for reading the whole manuscript and giving numerous suggestions for improvement.\nA preprint of this handbook was used in a training school organised by the COST action at the University of Málaga (16–18 April, 2012).

    "text": "1.1 Plant-Light Interactions\nLight plays two crucial roles in plants. It functions as a 1) source of energy and 2) as a source of information. In addition, when in excess, ultraviolet, visible and infrared radiation can impede plants’ normal functioning and result in damage or even death. As a source of energy, radiation can drive photochemical reactions or increase the temperature of plants and their environment. Warming by infrared radiation does not involve photochemical reactions, i.e., molecular structures, including chemical bonds, are not modified. Because of this, warming by thermal radiation is considered to be outside the scope of photobiology (see Monteith and Unsworth 2008).\nPhotochemical reactions can be beneficial or detrimental depending on the specific reaction. As a cue, light provides information that regulates development (timing), morphology (shape and size) and biochemistry (metabolites) of plants. Plant pigments also play a role in communication, especially with insects and other animals (see Lee 2007). These roles provide a criterion to classify plant pigments, or light-absorbing chemical species, including metabolites, that absorb ultraviolet and visible radiation (Figure 1.1).\nPhotosynthesis is the most obvious beneficial photochemically initiated metabolic process (see Shevela, Björn, and Govindjee 2019). Photoreactivation (repair) of DNA damage is also powered by light, while damage initiated by photochemistry is mainly dependent on UV radiation (see Hideg and Strid 2017). In addition to DNA other metabolites can be damaged by photochemical reactions including lipids and proteins. In some cases leading to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Acquisition of information from light is also initiated by photochemical reactions in photoreceptors [see @?????]. However, these sensory reactions involve quantitatively very little energy as photoreceptor pigments are present at very low concentrations in plant cells.\nFigure 1.2 shows the approximate wavelength ranges in which important plant-light interactions involving photochemistry take place. Thermal energy (not depicted) is also absorbed at longer wavelengths without involving photochemical reactions. In the case of plants photoreceptors, as in the case of colour vision in animals, including humans, the wavelength ranges that activate different photoreceptors partly overlap. The partial overlap is important for their function.\nFigure 1.2: Range of wavelengths sensed through different higher-plant photoreceptor families or able to drive photoreactions. DNA damage and repair, photosynthesis and photoreceptors; CRY: cryptochromes 1 and 2, PHOT: phototropins 1 and 2, ZTL: Zeitlupe, UVR8: “UV-B” photoreceptor, PHY: phytochromes A/B/C/D/E. A dark wide bar indicates wavelengths of high and well demonstrated activity and narrower lighter coloured bars wavelengths for which activity is less important or uncertain. The vertical dashed line indicates the shortest wavelength in sunlight at ground level.\nIn contrast to photoreceptors, pigments that are present in plants at high concentrations (mass pigments) capture significant amounts of energy. Photons used in photosynthesis contribute energy that is stored in metabolites that are beneficial to plant growth. in contrast, the energy captured by pigments contributing to protection is dissipated safely but without directly contributing to “constructive” metabolism (Figure 1.3).\nFigure 1.3: Optical properties of leaves (olive), screening pigments (brown) and photosynthetic pigments (green). Thick lines indicate high absorption and paler narrower lines moderate absorption by pigments, or absorptance or reflectance plus transmittance for whole leaves.\nThe optical properties of leaves depend both on absorption by pigments and optical phenomena that modify the path of photons, such as scattering in the mesophyll and reflection at the surface and within leaves (see Lee 2007; Johnsen 2012). Leaves can function as light traps, lengthening the path of photons within the leaf, thus, increasing the probability of interaction between incident photons and pigment molecules, i.e., enhancing the effectiveness of pigments (Vogelmann and Björn 1986).",

    "section": "1.2 Growth and damage",
    "text": "1.2 Growth and damage\nPlants are exposed to both ultraviolet (UV), visible (VIS) and infrared (IR) radiation in their natural habitats. The amount and quality of radiation they are exposed to depends on the time of the year, the latitude, the ground elevation, position in the canopy, clouds and aerosols, and for aquatic plants water depth and water quality. Acclimation, the expression of plastic responses in the phenotype of a plant in response to the environmental conditions at one point in time, determines its responses when exposed later in time to the same or a different condition (Aphalo and Sadras 2021). In recent years concerns have been raised about the potential confounding effects of maternal and within-generation “after effects” in research with plants, leading to the revision of criteria for publication in leading journals. However, “hardening” and “priming” practices based on the same physiological mechanisms have been exploited in plant cultivation for centuries.\nWhile PAR contributes most of the radiant energy used in photosynthesis, UV-B and UV-A2 radiation contribute none. UV-A1 can make a significant contribution to photosynthesis in plants adapted or acclimated to growth in low light or shade (xxxx?). Near infrared radiation (NIR) does not significantly drive photosynthesis on its own, but can enhance the photosynthesis rate when added to PAR (xxxx effect), and effect large enough to be relevant for indoor plant production (Zhen, Iersel, and Bugbee 2021). The contributions of UV-A1- and FR radiation as drivers of photosynthesis have been recently reassessed (see Turnbull, Barlow, and Adams 2013; Sun et al. 2024; Zhen, Iersel, and Bugbee 2022).\nThe role of light on plants’ growth has been studied at different levels of organization. As photosynthetic metabolism has been reviewed by other authors extensively in recent years we do not extend on it here (see Shevela, Björn, and Govindjee 2019). We instead focus on the link between energy captured by photosynthesis and growth, or accumulation of biomass in plants. For example, in agriculture in the absence of other limitations, the proportionality between intercepted radiation and crop growth and yield is well established (Goudrian1989?). This rather consistent relationship highlights the need of considering the multiple steps separating light interception from growth, and how regulation of multiple non-linear processes results in an overall linear relationship. The individual processes depicted in Figure 1.4 are those usually studied and thus relate directly to the methods described in this book.\nThe path from incident light to biomass has several steps, each one involving a partitioning of energy Figure 1.4. These steps involve optics, photochemistry, biochemistry, anatomical and whole plant development, and in production settings the harvest of a produce of commercial or other value.\nNot all radiation incident on a leaf is absorbed, not all absorbed photons contribute to photosynthesis. The products of photosynthesis only in part are used as “building blocks” of biomass, with a large part being used as a source of energy for metabolism via respiration. The energy released by respiration can be split into that contributing to the synthesis of persistent metabolites (“growth”) and that contributing to “maintenance” of already existing function, structures and metabolites (xxxx?). The accumulated biomass can be in part consumed by herbivores and pathogens, rendered a burden and discarded, or lost in other ways. In plant production only part of the accumulated biomass will be harvested. Further, part of the harvested produce may be discarded during post-harvest processing or damaged or lost during transport and storage (not shown in the diagram).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n\nL([Light&lt;br/&gt;_irradiance and spectrum_]) == 1 to 100% ==&gt; IL[Intercepted by leaves&lt;br/&gt;_leaf area index or LAI_]\nL -- 100 to 1% --&gt; NIL[Not intercepted by leaves&lt;br/&gt;_heats soil, branches, trunks..._] \nNIL -- 100% --&gt; WSA[Absorbed by objects] --&gt; ST1([Temperature of&lt;br/&gt;surroundings])\nIL == 70 to 90% (LEDs) ===&gt; Ab[Absorbed&lt;br/&gt;light] \nIL -- 5 to 20% (LEDs) --&gt; Rfl[[Reflected&lt;br/&gt;light]]\nIL -- 2 to 15% (LEDs) --&gt; Tfr[[Transmitted&lt;br/&gt;light]]\nAb ==&gt; Ph[Photosynthesis] == 2 to 5%&lt;br/&gt;of absorbed ==&gt; Ch([Chemical energy&lt;br/&gt;_metabolites_])\nAb --&gt; Fl[[Light&lt;br/&gt;_fluorescence_]]\nAb --&gt; He[Heat] --&gt; Tleaf([_temperature of leaves_])\nTleaf &lt;--&gt; Cv[Convection&lt;br/&gt;_cooling or warming_]\nTleaf --&gt; Tr[Transpiration&lt;br/&gt;_cooling_]\nTr -- water use --&gt; Sw([Soil water&lt;br/&gt;_water potential_]) \nCh == 0 to 70% (?) ==&gt; GRat([Growth rate])\nGRat ==&gt; Gr[Accumulated growth&lt;br/&gt;_plant size and shape_]\nCh -- 100 to 30% (?) --&gt; Mn[[Maintenance&lt;br/&gt;_defence and repair_]]\nCv &lt;--&gt; Tair([Air temperature])\nTr &lt;--&gt; Hair([Air water vapour])\nTleaf &lt;--&gt; Thr[Thermal radiation&lt;br/&gt;_cooling or warming_]\nThr &lt;--&gt; ST([Temperature of&lt;br/&gt;surroundings])\nGr == ?% ==&gt; Hv[[Harvested&lt;br/&gt;valuable produce*]]\nGr -- ?% --&gt; Wst[[\"Waste\"&lt;br/&gt;of no value*]]\nGr -- ?% --&gt; Ls[[Losses&lt;br/&gt;e.g., herbivory*]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Energy flow diagram depicting the main steps in the conversion of radiant energy into chemical energy in biomass. We highlight with thicker arrows the path of energy contributing to standing biomass and harvested produce. * What is considered valuable or not can depend on the aim even within a given activity, e.g. within agriculture, current grain harvest vs. sustainability.\n\n\n\nThe simple tree-like energy-flow diagram in Figure 1.4 ignores regulation. For example, photosynthesis starts with the absorption of photons but this event and many similar ones occurring in parallel propagate up the hierarchy to chloroplasts, cells, leaves, whole plants, fields, ecosystems and the biosphere. What appears to be a simple unidirectional flow of energy across levels in the hierarchy, it is not simple because the flow is under regulation. Light and other cues from the environment play roles as sources of information for regulation of the different individual processes. Regulation and control of the flow of energy takes place concurrently across multiple levels of organization. Regulation mechanisms and interactions create regulatory control loops and paths that go backwards with respect to the main flow of energy, allowing higher levels in the hierarchy to affect lower levels. For example, a change in the display of leaves will affect the availability of energy for photosynthesis by affecting interception of radiation and will ultimately alter growth.\nAll biological systems are complex, and oversimplification needs to be avoided (see Fritjof Capra 2019). The most error prone step is obviously extrapolation back from a simplified model system under study to the real world with all its complexity. Consequently, it is necessary to remain aware at all times of differences between the context in which we do research and that of applications in the real world (Aphalo and Sadras 2021; Sadras et al. 2021).\nBoth UV and PAR when in excess can damage plants. We use excess here to indicate irradiance or length of irradiation in excess of those to which the genotype has adapted to and the phenotype has acclimated to, thus excess is a relative rather than an absolute measure. Light of an unnatural spectral composition can also challenge normal growth by disrupting light-dependent regulation and protection mechanisms, including acclimation. As plants’ metabolism and gene expression as well as metabolic regulation vary through the day, unnatural timing of events also plays a key role in disturbances leading to damage and impaired growth. Given that UV-B photons carry more energy the shorter the wavelength, in sunlight, UV-B radiation is the most likely to break chemical bonds. However, plants have evolved efficient protection and repair mechanisms against UV radiation and the damage it can cause.\nFrom the 1970’s until the 1990’s the main interest in research on the effects of UV-B radiation on plants and other organisms was generated by the increase in ambient UV-B exposure caused by ozone depletion in the stratosphere (e.g., Caldwell 1971; Caldwell, Teramura, and Tevini 1989; Tevini 1993; Caldwell and Flint 1994). This led to many studies on the effects of increased UV-B radiation, both outdoors, in greenhouses and in controlled environments. Frequently, the results obtained in outdoor experiments differed from those obtained indoors. This led to the realization that it is important to use realistic experimental conditions with respect to UV-B radiation and its ratio compared to other wavelength bands of the solar spectrum. Interactions of responses to UV-B radiation with other environmental factors like availability of mineral nutrients, water and temperature, were also uncovered. Effects of stratospheric ozone depletion, and the concomitant increase in UV-B radiation on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems have been periodically reviewed by UNEP (UNEP20xx? and earlier reports).\nThe balance between the different wavebands, UV-B, UV-A2, UV-A1 and PAR, has a big influence on the effect of UV-B radiation on plants. Unrealistically low levels of UV-A radiation and PAR potentiate the effect of UV-B radiation (e.g. Caldwell, Flint, and Searles 1994). One reason for this is that UV-A and blue radiation are required for photoreactivation, the repair of DNA damage in the light. Another reason is the role of UV-A and PAR irradiance in acclimation and regulation of photosynthesis. For example, a high irradiance of blue light and a high red:far-red photon ratio induce accumulation of screening pigments, antioxidant capacity and deployment of other protection and repair mechanisms. These are mainly responses mediated by photoreceptors, that we discuss next.",

    "section": "1.3 Sensing and cues",
    "text": "1.3 Sensing and cues\nPlants photoreceptors from each of the families shown in Figure 1.2 are widely distributed in the plant kingdom. Cryptochromes are present in animals in addition to in plants. The number of members from each family varies across plant species, as gene duplications have taken place during evolution. Polyploidy, also results in multiple copies of genes, and these can subsequently evolve to play distinct roles or retain partly redundant function.\nThe first plant photoreceptor family identified was that of phytochromes (Sage 1992). Cryptochromes, phototropins, and UVR8 were identified years later. Several recent reviews are available (see Podolec, Demarsy, and Ulm 2021a; Rai, Morales, and Aphalo 2021; Q. Wang and Lin 2020; Morrow, Willenburg, and Liscum 2018; xxxxx?). We focus here on the most recently discovered photoreceptor family, UVR8, and the role of the complex downstream signalling network responsible for metabolic, morphogenic and developmental regulation.\nThe UVR8 photoreceptor is widely distributed in plants, and while there is only one UVR8 photoreceptor in Arabidopsis, many species are now known to have more than one photoreceptor in the UVR8 family (Tossi et al. 2019). In the case of cryptochromes, phototropins and phytochromes, higher plants have multiple photoreceptors in each of these families (e.g., Taiz et al. 2015, chap. 15). Maybe Javier could add a couple of lines about mosses, liverworts, etc. (Soriano et al. 2017) In lichens, the accumulation of UV-protective pigments is induced mainly by UV-B radiation (Solhaug et al. 2003). These pigments are produced by the mycobiont and protect the photobiont (Váczi, Gauslaa, and Solhaug 2018). It has been, however, reported that the UVR8 photoreceptor distribution is restricted to the Viridiplantae (Fernández et al. 2016), which seems contradictory unless the photobiont “talks” to the mycobiont or the mycobiont senses UV-B by an alternative mechanism. Is there something new known about this?\nNowadays, with ozone depletion less of an issue than a few decades ago, more emphasis is put on the role of UV radiation as a regulator of plants’ structure and function than as a cause of damage. Wavelengths in the UV-B, UV-A, PAR and NIR are now known to play roles in the regulation of metabolism, growth, development and acclimation of plants, affording tolerance to elevated PAR, UV radiation, drought, etc., through the activation of photoreceptors (Figure 1.2). Radiation of different wavelengths activate different photoreceptors and photochemical reactions, triggering complex interactive physiological responses, which currently are only partially understood.\nMolecular studies have revealed a complex signalling network downstream of plant photoreceptors, which creates crosstalk leading to multiple interactions among the responses to different wavelengths. Photoreceptors regulate gene expression and in some cases also faster responses like opening and closing of ion-channels in cell membranes. The primary events sensed individually by more than a dozen photoreceptors in plants are combined during transduction making possibly a huge number qualitatively and quantitatively distinct responses depending on multiple properties of illumination: irradiance (= flux density), spectrum (= colour), direction and timing (sunflecks, day/night, seasons).\nIndividual photoreceptors can have multiple modes of action (Casal, Sánchez, and Botto 1998; Podolec, Demarsy, and Ulm 2021b) and the activity of one photorepector may down regulate, up regulate or inhibit the perception of cues by a different photoreceptor (Casal 2009; Zhao et al. 2023). UVR8 and cryptochrome photoreceptors reciprocally modulate their activity at the signalling level through COP1 and BES mediated-interaction, RUP- and BIC- mediated and BES1- and BIM1 mediated interactions also play a role, as well as other transcription factors including HY5 and through optical feedback (Figure 1.5) (Rai et al. 2019, 2020; Tissot and Ulm 2020; Podolec, Demarsy, and Ulm 2021b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Interactions in the perception of solar UV radiation (reproduced from Rai, Morales, and Aphalo 2021). A model combining different hypotheses for coaction downstream of UVR8 and CRYs in UV responses and possible modulation by other wavelengths. We postulate a first level of interaction through COP1 as both UVR8 and CRYs physically interact with COP1, a second level through shared TFs (eg., HY5, BES1 and BIM1, note that both UVR8 and CRYs physically interact with BES1 and BIM1), and a third level through RUPs and BICs. The complete arrows show paths supported by experimental evidence while the dotted arrows show hypothetical mechanisms that are compatible with current knowledge. Numbers 1, 2 and 3 refer to negative feedback loops. UV-Asw: short wavelength UV-A \\approx UV-A2; UV-Alw: long wavelength UV-A \\approx UV-A1.\n\n\n\nInteractions are not limited to molecular signalling. Cryptochromes function both as photo- and magnetoreceptors (Ahmad et al. 2007; Pooam et al. 2018) while phytochromes function both as photo- and thermoreceptors (Casal and Balasubramanian 2019). Downstream of gene expression additional routes for interactions exist: many sensory responses to UV and VIS radiation are mediated by changes in metabolism, catabolism and sensing of phytohormones, including abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellic acid, jasmonic acid, brassinosteroids and auxins (Figure 1.6) (Fernández-Milmanda and Ballaré 2021). Absorptive sun-screens or reflective structures in the epidermis, frequently induced by UV and VIS radiation, modify the light environment within leaves (see Rai, Morales, and Aphalo 2021) and even UV-induced VIS fluorescence of mass pigments such as chlorophylls and phenolic metabolites could potentially be sensed by “unexpected” photoreceptors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Example of downstream role of phytohormones in light signalling (reproduced from Fernández-Milmanda and Ballaré 2021). Neighbour proximity signals, including reflected FR and horizontal blue light gradients trigger early responses including elongation and bending toward canopy gaps, acting via phyB and phots, respectively. Shading results in progressive inactivation of phyB, crys, and UVR8, leading to enhanced activity of (i) growth-promoting PIF transcription factors [12], and (ii) the E3 ligase complex COP1/SPA, which controls the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the growth-inhibiting transcription factor HY5 [93]. PIFs trigger elongation responses through the canonical PIF–auxin (IAA) pathway (red arrow). An intricate network of interactions downstream of the photoreceptors allows plants to incorporate information from multiple light signals to optimize their response. For example, cry inactivation under low blue light potentiates the elongation response triggered by low R:FR via (i) increased PIF abundance and activity, and (ii) attenuation of the low R:FR-induced negative-feedback loop that depends on negative regulators of PIF activity. The latter effect of cry1 inactivation is mediated by reduced gene expression of negative regulators and reduced HFR1 levels through a COP1-dependent mechanism [17]. In addition, low R:FR [20] and low blue [33] increase the intensity of phototropic responses (mediated by phots) when the plant is shaded by other plants. This is because inactivation of phyB and cry increase PIF activity, resulting in enhanced auxin signaling in the hypocotyl and, upon phototropic stimulation, a steeper auxin signaling gradient across the organ. In canopy gaps, solar UV radiation, acting via UVR8, attenuates elongation responses to low R:FR ratios by promoting the degradation of PIF4 and PIF5 and by stabilizing growth-repressing DELLA proteins [25]. Photoactivated UVR8 interacts with COP1, which reduces the activity of PIFs via at least two mechanisms: (i) by preventing a (noncanonical) effect of COP1 that increases the stability of PIF5 [31], and (ii) by stabilizing the negative regulator HFR1 (a COP1 substrate) [32]. In addition to altering auxin metabolism and transport, PIFs and COP1/SPA activate a suite of changes in GA (details in Fernández-Milmanda and Ballaré 2021, fig. 3) and JA signaling (details in Fernández-Milmanda and Ballaré 2021, fig. 4), which leads to a major reconfiguration of the growth and defense phenotype.

Further downstream, HY5 and PIFs mediated signalling depends on UVR8(s) and cryptochromes but also on phytochromes (Sellaro et al. 2024) and phototropins (Vandenbussche et al. 2014). A recent proposal is that the multiple roles played by photoreceptors sharing signalling network components are made possible by compartimentalization into distinct tissues and cell-types (Depaepe, Vanhaelewyn, and Van Der Straeten 2023).\nIn recent years, the importance of the role of time and timing in responses to UV radiation became obvious. Outdoors, the light spectrum changes during the course of the day and with seasons, with proportionally more UV-B radiation the higher is the sun in the sky. This could explain some of the time-dependent responses of plants growing in the field. However, in addition, the circadian clock regulates gene expression, and other responses to light mediated by photoreceptors\nThe photoreceptors UVR8, CRYs and PHYs jointly control responses affecting optical properties and display of leaves that can modify the sensitivity to UV radiation by attenuating it or reducing its interception (Rai, Morales, and Aphalo 2021). The optical properties of the epidermis vary strongly in response to exposure to blue light and UV radiation and may also vary even during the day (Barnes et al. 2015) and seasonally (Pescheck2019?).\nEven changes in optical properties of single stranded DNA in chloroplasts can affect sensitivity to damage by UV-B exposure (Saeid Nia et al. 2023). Plant species differ in their responses as a result of evolution; however broad patterns can be detected across species on the responses to different wavelength bands of sunlight (e.g., Q.-W. Wang et al. 2020). Thus, current understanding of plant responses to UV, VIS and NIR radiation indicates that a broad perspective is needed in the study of plants’ responses to UV and VIS radiation across multiple time scales (Barnes 2017; Barnes et al. 2018; Robson et al. 2019).\nIn sunlight, because of the shape of the solar spectrum, UVR8 “the UV-B photoreceptor” mediates responses to both UV-B and UV-A2 radiation, while CRYs are more responsive to solar blue light than to UV-A1 radiation (Rai, Morales, and Aphalo 2021). That responses to UV-A1 and UV-A2 radiation are mediated by different photoreceptors, introduces the need to differentiate between UV-A1 and UV-A2 in controlled environments as well as outdoors (Rai, Morales, and Aphalo 2021). In the case of some responses, UVR8- and CRY-dependent responses complement each other, and a strong phenotype is observed only when both photoreceptors are inactive (Rai et al. 2020; Tissot and Ulm 2020). When considering UV experiments in the field, these distinct roles of UV-A1 and UV-A2 in sunlight provide a possible explanation to some of the puzzling effects previously reported for UV-A controls in UV-B experiments (Verdaguer et al. 2017).\nBoth acclimation and adaptation are crucial to fitness of wild plants, and for yield of crops subjected to breeding (Aphalo and Sadras 2022). As a result of adaptation and breeding the genotype changes over multiple generations, more precisely the frequency of alleles encoding selected-for traits increases in the population. Acclimation is the result of plasticity allowing the expression of different phenotypes from a given genotype. Acclimation occurs when the previously experienced environment affects later responses favourably. Acclimation can be triggered by a cue or variable that is not necessarily mechanistically related to the later response. This is so because environmental correlations in the natural environment are exploited by plants and other organisms as sources of information (Aphalo and Sadras 2022). Time is important with respect to the developmental stage and previous “experience” (a life-time memory) (Rai et al. 2019) and, in some cases at least, previous generations’ “experience” (maternal effects) (Yan et al. 2020). Developmental stages also impose constraints on acclimation, because as the life of a plant progresses, more past commitments limit the remaining room for plasticity (Novoplansky 2009).\nAcclimation of stomatal responses to visible in response to exposure to UV radiation (Ač et al. 2024) and of photosynthesis to high versus low light levels (Brelsford et al. 2018), can be relevant to drought tolerance (Jansen et al. 2021; Aphalo and Sadras 2022) and also involves the participation of photoreceptors, sensing UV radiation. In the case of stomata, acclimation dependent on UV radiation can involve changes in opening speed as well as in relative sensitivity to radiation of different wavelengths (Aasamaa and Aphalo 2017). However, a direct role of UV radiation in stomatal opening and closing at a time scale of minutes remains controversial.\nThe importance of photoperiodism in some plants’ responses has been recognised for a long time. However, recent progress has shown that not only photoperiodic, stomatal and photosynthesis responses but also photomorphogenic responses depend on the time of day (Sellaro et al. 2024). The daily time course of UVR8 dimerization state (Liao et al. 2020) and the seasonality of responses mediated by UVR8 are also two important aspects of timing (Coffey and Jansen 2018).\nTemporal (from seasonal to milliseconds) and spatial heterogeneity in the light environment of plants are an ever present feature outdoors (Hartikainen et al. 2020; Kotilainen et al. 2020; Durand and Robson 2023). Furthermore, even if in its infancy, the study of responses to pulsed light has shown that photoreceptor-dependent responses are not proportional to the average light conditions during the photoperiod, but instead, temporal integration of cues is far more complex and can involve multiple photoreceptors, including UVR8, and PHYs (Sellaro et al. 2024).\nIn recent years the choice of species has been influenced by the increasing interest in the potential use of UV wavelengths in protected cropping, where exposure to UV radiation can be used to increase the content of desirable plant metabolites (Neugart and Schreiner 2018; Crestani et al. 2024), adjust plant morphology resulting in a more compact and stocky plant (Qian et al. 2021) and induce stress resistance (Crestani et al. 2023). Similar effects of specific wavelength bands of visible radiation have been described (e.g. Popp 1926; Wassink and Stolwijk 1956) and their relevance to horticulture recognized (e.g. Reinders-Gouwentak, Smeet, and Andeweg 1951) already long time ago. The increasing adoption of LED-based illumination for plant cultivation facilitates the use of different spectra. This has lead to increased interest in research on plant cultivation under artificial illumination and the optimization of energy use targeting harvest volume as well as organoleptic and nutritional quality (XXXXXX?). To study plant responses to UV, VIS and/or NIR radiation, consideration of the whole daylight spectrum as well as of the life history of the plants is necessary. It is also necessary to keep in mind relevance to agriculture (Sadras et al. 2021), biological resilience (Thorogood et al. 2023) and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\nAt the time the first edition was published, it had already been recognised that the balance between UV-B radiation and longer wavelengths and the timing of UV-B exposure at noon were needed for relevance of research to plants growing in sunlight. Research since then has revealed complex signalling, making it important also for mechanistic UV studies in controlled environments to be aware of VIS and NIR radiation and the corresponding photoreceptors, and vice-versa. This is reflected in that several currently active research groups have already bridged the artificial divide between UV plant photobiology and the rest of plant photobiology.",

Later chapters cover skills in the design of experiments, quantification and manipulation of the UV and VIS radiation environment, plant cultivation, data collection, data visualization and data analysis.

    "text": "2.1 Introduction\nI have retained the use of quantity symbols and names from the first edition. The SI system was updated in 2019 and the IUPAC Gold Book in 2020. I/we have to check that the symbols and nomenclature we use are up-to-date with these updates.\nMost if not all organisms are in a way or another directly dependent on light (Björn 2015). For humans and most animals, vision is necessary for navigation and communication. Body colour can both enhance visibility and serve as camouflage. For photoautotrophs like plants, light is a source of energy for growth when captured through photosynthesis, but also when sensed through photoreceptors, a source of information. Flower colours and visual patterns are a means of light-mediated communication (Figure 2.1).\nAs a source of energy, short wavelength radiation, if in excess, can damage unprotected tissues through uncontrolled photochemical reactions, i.e., by UV-B exposure breaking bonds in molecules (e.g., Rousseaux et al. 1999). However, these short wavelengths together with longer wavelengths make organisms and objects warmer when they are absorbed. Thus, radiation-driven overheating can also damage tissues and cause the death of organisms, including plants (e.g., xxxxx?).\nDepending on the intensity and timing, radiation of any wavelength from UV-B to thermal infrared can be damaging or beneficial to organisms, including plants. For a given exposure to radiation, the optical properties of vegetation, plants, individual organs such as leaves, tissues, cells and even organelles modulate the fate of the incident energy: radiation that is not absorbed or that is safely dissipated after absorption does not cause damage. White reflective waxes, pubescence, paraheliotropy, and chloroplast accumulation decrease radiation absorption (Figure 2.2), while screening pigments in the epidermis, transpiration, and small-sized leaves contribute to safe dissipation of energy. For radiation that reaches into chloroplasts, biochemical mechanisms for the dissipation have evolved, such as carotenoid cycling.\nSensing of light through photoreceptors as well as its conversion into chemical energy by photosynthesis, start at a photochemical reaction where one (or occasionally two or more) photons transfer energy to a pigment molecule to excite it. Quantum physics helps explain phenomena observable at larger scales, such as action spectra for whole-plant responses.\nIn addition to plant’s optical properties, in photobiology research, optics and radiation physics play a crucial role in the design of experiments and reporting of treatment conditions. For example, when studying photosynthesis using chlorophyll fluorescence, the correct interpretation of the measured yield must be based on the absorbed photons, not the incident ones. Radiation needs to be quantified in a way relevant to the object of study. The optical properties of experimental set-ups, need to be adjusted to the aims of each experiment and, crucially, have to be accurately described. This makes it necessary for those doing research in photobiology to have a good command of how UV, visible and infrared radiation interact with different objects and organisms. The aim of this chapter is to provide such a foundation as support for later chapters in the book.",

    "section": "2.2 Wavelength and Colour",
    "text": "2.2 Wavelength and Colour\nRadiation, or radiant energy, can be described as waves, with wavelength or frequency as properties, or based on quantum physics, as photons of specific energy. This “double personality” of light is important as each approach provides a simpler explanation than the other one for different specific phenomena, such as refraction and reflection at boundaries between materials and absorption of radiation by pigments and other molecules. From the first perspective, ultraviolet (UV), visible (VIS), and infrared (IR) radiation are electromagnetic waves and are described by the Maxwell’s equations.1 From the second perspective, Plank’s law describes the energy of a quantum as inversely proportional to wavelength.\nThe wavelength ranges of visible radiation, described by their colour based on human vision’s response to monochromatic light, are shown in Figure 2.3, topmost bar of wavebands. The colour ranges indicated in Figure 2.3 are one approximation out of several available. We follow the ISO and CIE standards when applicable. The electromagnetic spectrum is continuous with no clear boundaries between one colour and the next. Colours are the result of the interaction of different wavelengths of radiation with the photoreceptor pigments in the eye and the processing of the stimuli by the brain. Alternative definitions based on other sensory systems or energy capture systems are available, some of them applicable to plants are shown in Figure 2.3, two lowermost bars of wavebands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: The solar spectrum, 280-900\\,\\mathrm{nm}, and different commonly used named wavebands.

In Figure 2.4 they are shown for a wider range of wavelengths. It is important to keep in mind that the ISO and CIE definitions of the VIS and UV wavebands overlap. Thus, it is incorrect to sum VIS and UV irradiances, while the definitions of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and UV do not overlap. Especially in the IR region, the subdivision is somewhat arbitrary and the boundaries used in the literature vary, with differences even between ISO and CIE standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: The solar spectrum, 250-3000\\,\\mathrm{nm}, and different commonly used named wavebands.

    "section": "2.3 Angle of Incidence",
    "text": "2.3 Angle of Incidence\nMost frequently we describe the flux of radiation on a plane, usually, but not always a horizontal plane (Figure 2.5). This flux is called irradiance and expressed per unit area and unit time. The area used as a reference is that of the receiving plane. Fluence rate is measured on the surface of a sphere instead of a plane. In this case, the plane is located in three-dimensional (3D) space. When considering a point source of radiation, the angle, \\alpha, between the light beam and the receiving plane or surface affects the received irradiance: the shallower the angle of incidence the lower the irradiance from the same beam of light. Both irradiance and fluence rate are fluxes of radiation, expressed per unit area and unit time (Figure 2.5). In the first case the area is that of the illuminated planar surface and in the second case of an spherical surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: The concepts of irradiance and fluence rate explained. (A) A beam of radiation perpendicular to the plane of an irradiance sensor; irradiance and fluence rate have the same numerical value. (B) Radiation beam at an angle to the irradiance sensor; irradiance has a smaller numerical value than fluence rate. (C) Perfectly diffuse radiation from the hemisphere above the irradiance sensor; the numerical value of irradiance is one half that of fluence rate. (D) Perfectly diffuse radiation from both hemispheres, both above and below the sensors; the numerical value of irradiance is one quarter that of fluence rate. A spherical sensor (left) measures fluence rate, and a one-sided planar sensor (right) measures irradiance. In (A) and (B) radiation is collimated and represented by parallel arrows. In (C) and (D) radiation is diffuse and represented by “randomly” oriented arrows. In (A), (B) and (C) the shaded hemisphere of the spherical sensor is grey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSensors and their shape\n\n\n\nThere are, in principle, two possible approaches to measuring radiation. The first is to observe light from one specific direction or viewing angle, which is the radiance L. The second is to use a detector, which senses radiation from more than one direction and measures radiation impinging it from all directions from an enclosing sphere or hemisphere. The relation between irradiance E and radiance L at wavelength \\lambda is given by integrating incoming photons over these directions.\n\\begin{aligned}\nE[0](\\lambda) & = \\int_\\Omega L(\\lambda,\\Omega) {\\rm d}\\Omega \\label{equ_E0} \\\\\nE(\\lambda) & = \\int_\\Omega I(\\lambda,\\Omega) |\\cos\\alpha| {\\rm d}\\Omega \\label{equ_E}\n%\\end{eqnarray}\n\\end{aligned}\nThe shape of a detector entrance-optics, planar or spherical, determines the measured physical quantity, and the weight given to photons from different directions (Figure 2.5). Collection of light on a flat surface (or equivalently through an small opening in an integrating sphere) yields irradiance, energy irradiance, E, or photon irradiance, Q depending on the spectral response of the detector. A spherical collecting surface, yields fluence rate (also called scalar irradiance) E_0, Q_0. In practice, all spherical sensors have a blind stop due to necesary support and connection to a readout device.\n\n\nThe sun, can be assumed to be a point source (the solar disk is \\approx 1 ^\\circ in diameter when seen from Earth). Changes in distance that are of interest when studying plants are extremely small relative to the total Sun to Earth distance and can be ignored. Thus, in the case of direct sunlight, we have to consider only the angle of incidence. For a given light source the maximum irradiance is that received on a plane normal to the light beam (Figure 2.5). As the angle between the beam and the surface becomes shallower, the irradiance measured on the plane decreases, reaching zero, when the beam is parallel to the surface. The relationship between the normal area and that at a shallower angle is given by the cosine of the angle \\alpha. When considering the sun, if the receiving plane is horizontal, the angle of interest is the zenith angle (1 - solar elevation angle) (Figure 2.6). If the plane is not horizontal, the angle between the plane and the light beam depends both the the zenith angle and the azimuth angle of the sun’s position, and the effective angle needs to be computed in three dimensions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Asimuth and elevation angles of the sun. If the plane on which irradiance is measured is horizontal, the Azimuth angle does not affect the incident angle, and it is enough to only take into account the elevation angle. Modified from figure by TWCarlson - Azimut altitude.svg, CC BY-SA 3.0 file at wikimedia.org.\n\n\n\nObviously, the discussion above ignored scattered radiation from the sky. One approach to the simulation of the light field when multiple sources or sources with a large emitting area are present, is to use ray tracing, which is essentially a divide and conquer approach.\nWhen we considered a point source like a bare LED chip or light from a small light bulb at a relatively short distance from the receiving plane, distance cannot be ignored as done above for the sun, as the illuminated area increases four times for each doubling in the distance. Thus, each doubling in distance decreases irradiance by 75%.\nIn the case of light sources with a large surface relative to the illuminated area or light beams focused by a lens or reflector, the rate of increase in area is smaller than for a point source. The extreme case is a highly collimated laser beam, for which the illuminated area increases very slowly with increasing distance. The irradiance, in these cases, is frequently not uniform within the illuminated area, with in most cases higher iradiance at the centre than at the edges of the illuminated area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nUsing a lens or reflector to make a light beam narrower makes it possible to increase irradiance by concentrating the light energy onto a smaller illuminated area, and this effect can be quantitatively large. Alternatively, the narrower beam makes it possible to move the light source away from the illuminated object maintaining the same irradiance. This can provide additional space for other equipment, or when using selective reflectors that transmit infrared radiation and only reflect VIS and/or UV radiation reduce the heat load on the illuminated object.\n\n\nIn a perfectly collimated beam, the photons follow parallel trajectories. In a beam from a ideal point source the trajectories of the photons are equally probable in all directions (away from the centre of an imaginary sphere). Most real light sources behave somewhere in between these extremes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAngle of Incidence in 3D\n\n\n\nWhile in Figure 2.6, we had the sensor or observer at the centre, and the light source located on an imaginary sphere, here, instead, we locate the point light source at the centre of the sphere. So, when a beam or the radiation passing into a space or sphere is analysed, two important parameters are necessary: the distance to the source and the position of the measurement plane—i.e., if the receiving surface is perpendicular to the beam or at a shallower angle. The geometry is illustrated in Figure 2.7. The radiation is received at distance r by a surface of area dA, tilted by an angle \\alpha to the unit sphere’s surface element, a solid angle, d\\Omega, which is a two-dimensional angle in a space. The relation between dA and d\\Omega in spherical coordinates is geometrically explained in Figure 2.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Definition of the solid angle dΩ and the geometry of areas in the space (redrawn after Eichler et al. 1993), where the given solid angle dΩ remains the same, regardless of distance r , while the exposed area exemplified by dA will change with distance r from the origin (light source) and the angle α, if the exposed area (or detector) is tilted. The angle denoted by φ is the azimuth angle and θ is the zenith angle.\n\n\n\nThe solid angle is calculated from the zenith angle \\theta and azimuth angle \\phi, which denote the direction of the radiation beam\n{\\rm d}\\Omega = {\\rm d}\\theta\\cdot\\sin\\theta{\\rm d}\\phi \\label{equ_dsolidangle} The area of the receiving surface is calculated by a combination of the solid angle of the beam, the distance r from the radiation source and the angle \\alpha of the tilt:\n{\\rm d}A  =  \\frac{r{\\rm d}\\theta}{\\cos\\alpha}\\cdot r\\sin\\theta{\\rm d}\\phi which can be rearranged to\n\\Rightarrow {\\rm d}A  =  \\frac{r^2}{\\cos\\alpha}\\quad{\\rm d}\\Omega Thus, the solid angle is given by\n\\Omega = \\int_A \\frac{{\\rm d}A\\cdot\\cos\\alpha}{r^2} \\label{equ_solidangle} The unit of the solid angle is a steradian (sr). The solid angle of an entire sphere is calculated by integration of the equation above over the zenith (\\theta) and azimuth (\\phi) angles, 0\\le\\theta\\le\\pi(180^\\circ) and 0\\le\\phi\\le2\\pi(360^\\circ), and is 4\\pi sr.\n\n\n\n2.3.1 Radiation Quantities\nThe amount of radiation can be quantified in different ways. Each quantity is useful in different circumstances. We have already used some of these quantities above, here we Quantities can describe flows (energy per unit time), flux rates (energy per unit time and unit area), exposure (energy per event and unit area), radiant flux (energy per unit time) and radiance (energy per unit area and solid angle). The shape of the receiving surface can be a plane, a sphere, a hemisphere or even a cylinder. In the case of radiance, the angle of acceptance of the sensor can also vary but is usually narrow (\\leq 10^\\circ). These definitions are independent of wavelengths, but the quantities are in most cases used to describe energy integrated over a certain range of wavelengths based on the “named” wavebands shown in Figure 2.3 and Figure 2.4. The definitions and symbols of several physical quantities used to describe the “amount of radiation” are given in Table 2.1.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Energy based radiation quantities. Commonly used symbols and units in the SI (Systeme Internationale).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nUnit\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\\Phi=\\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial t}\nW = J s^{-1}\nRadiant flux: absorbed or emitted energy per time interval\n\n\nH=\\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial A}\nJ m^{-2}\nExposure: energy towards a surface area. (In plant research this is called usually dose (), while in Physics dose refers to absorbed radiation.)\n\n\nE=\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial A}\nW m^{-2}\nIrradiance: flux or radiation towards a surface area, radiant flux density\n\n\nI=\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial\\Omega}\nW sr^{-1}\nRadiant intensity: emitted radiant flux of a surface area per solid angle\n\n\n\\epsilon=\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial A}\nW m^{-2}\nEmittance: emitted radiant flux per surface area\n\n\nL=\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Phi}{\\partial \\Omega (\\partial A\\cdot \\cos\\alpha)}=\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial A\\cdot\\cos\\alpha}\nW m^{-2} sr^{-1}\nRadiance: emitted radiant flux per solid angle and surface area depending on the angle between radiant flux and surface perpendicular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking into account Figure 2.7, the corresponding equations and assuming a homogenous flux, the relation between irradiance E and intensity I is given by E = \\frac{I \\times \\cos\\alpha}{r^2} \\label{equ_r2law}. The irradiance decreases by the square of the distance to the source and depends on the tilt of the detecting surface area, \\alpha. This is valid only for theretical point sources, and a good approximation for small ones. For outdoor measurements the sun can be assumed to be a point source. For artificial light sources simple LEDs (light-emitting diodes) without optics on top are also effectively point sources. However, LEDs with optics—and other artificial light sources with optics or reflectors designed to give a narrower light beam—deviate to various extents from the rule of a decrease of irradiance proportional to the square of the distance from the light source.\nWhen we are interested in photochemical reactions, the most relevant radiation quantities are those expressed in photons. The reason for this is that, as discussed in ?sec-radiation-photochemistry-principles, molecules are excited by the absorption of certain fixed amounts of energy or quanta. The surplus energy “decays” by non-photochemical processes. When studying photosynthesis, where many photons of different wavelengths are simultaneously important, we normally use photon irradiance to describe amount of . The name photosynthetic photon flux density, or , is also frequently used when referring to photon irradiance. When dealing with energy balance of an object instead of photochemistry, we use (energy) irradiance. In meteorology both and visible radiation, are quantified using energy-based quantities. When dealing with photochemistry as in responses mediated by UVR8, a photoreceptor, the use of quantum quantities is preferred. Photon based radiation quantities are listed in Table 2.2, the symbol Q (“quanta”) is used for photon irradiance.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.2: Photon-based radiation quantities. Commonly used symbols and units in the SI (Systeme Internationale).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nUnit\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\\Phi_\\mathrm{p}\ns^{-1}\nPhoton flux: number of photons per time interval\n\n\nQ=\\frac{\\partial \\Phi_\\mathrm{p}}{\\partial A}\nm^{-2} s^{-1}\nPhoton irradiance: photon flux towards a surface area, photon flux density (earlier frequently called photon flux density and abbreviated as PFD)\n\n\nH_p=\\int_t\\;Q\\;\\mathrm{d}t\nm^{-2}\nPhoton exposure: number of photons towards a surface area during a time interval, photon fluence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese quantities can be also used based on a ‘chemical’ amount of moles by dividing the quantities by Avogadro’s number N_A=6.022\\times 10^{23} mol^{-1}. To determine a quantity in terms of photons, an energetic quantity has to be weighted by the number of photons, i.e., divided by the energy of a single photon at each wavelength as defined in equation XXXX. This yields, for example, \\Phi_\\mathrm{p} = \\frac{\\lambda}{h\\;c}\\times\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial t}\\hspace{1cm}\\mathrm{and}\\hspace{1cm}Q(\\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda}{h\\;c}\\times E(\\lambda) When dealing with bands of wavelengths, for example an integrated value like from 400 to 700 nm, it is necessary to repeat these calculations at each wavelength and then integrate over the wavelengths. For example, the photon irradiance or in moles of photons is obtained by Q_\\mathrm{PAR} = \\frac{1}{N_\\mathrm{A}}\\int_{400\\;\\mathrm{nm}}^{700\\,\\mathrm{nm}}\\frac{\\lambda}{hc}\\;E(\\lambda)\\;\\mathrm{d}\\lambda For integrated values of or radiation the calculation is done analogously by integrating from 280 to 315 nm or 315 to 400 nm, respectively.\nIf we have measured (energy) irradiance, and want to convert this value to photon irradiance, the exact conversion will be possible only if we have information about the spectral composition of the measured radiation. Conversion factors at different wavelengths are given below in Table 2.3. For “average daylight” in the wavelength band 400 to 700 nm the conversion factor is approximately 4.6\\,\\mathrm{\\mu mol\\,J^{-1}}. This is exact at a wavelength at 550 nm, and will deviate depending on the shape of the spectrum.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.3: Energy per photon and conversion factors between photon and energy quantities at different wavelengths. The factors assume Q values are expressed as \\mathrm{\\mu mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}} and I values as \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}.

Although quantitatively irrelevant to systems other that human vision, they are commonly used by lamp manufacturers to describe light output of artificial light sources. Photometric sensors are also the most widely available. Photometric or illumination quantities are expressed in different units than those of physical quantities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotometric quantities\n\n\n\nIn contrast to (spectro-)radiometry, where the energy of any electromagnetic radiation is measured in terms of absolute power (J\\,s^{-1} = W), photometry measures light as perceived by the human eye. Therefore, radiation is weighted by a luminosity function or visual sensitivity function describing the wavelength dependent response of the human eye. Due to the physiology of the eye, having rods and cones as light receptors, different sensitivity functions exist for the day (photopic vision) and night (scotopic vision), V(\\lambda) and V'(\\lambda), respectively (Figure 2.8). The maximum response during the day is at \\lambda=555 nm and during night at \\lambda=507 nm. Both response functions (normalised to their maximum) are shown in the figure below as established by the Commission Internationale de l’Éclairage (CIE, International Commission on Illumination, Vienna, Austria) in 1924 for photopic vision and 1951 for scotopic vision (Schwiegerling 2004). The data are available from the Colour and Vision Research Laboratory. The photopic response, V(\\lambda), is used as the basis of all photometric measurements. However, for very low irradiance, it is possible to compute similar quantities using the scotopic response V'(\\lambda).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Photopic response of the human eye, V(\\lambda), normalised. This is the 2 degrees curve. The numbers in the colour bar, indicate the relative sensitivity, as a percent, to different colours of light as defined in standard ISO 21348.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: It is important to be aware that these response curves are based on a small number of subjects and, due to variation, not necessarily representative of any individual person, or even of persons of different age or of other ethnicities than those in the study in which the data for the curves were obtained.\nIf we convolute (multiply wavelength by wavelength) the photopic response spectrum with a spectral irradiance we obtain a new curve (Figure 2.9). The area under this curve, multiplies by a constant, is a measure of the perceived brightness of the light by a “typical” human observer, in this case, E_\\mathrm{v} = 103\\,\\mathrm{klx}.\n\n\nWarning: &lt;ggplot&gt; %+% x was deprecated in ggplot2 4.0.0.\nℹ Please use &lt;ggplot&gt; + x instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: Photopic response of the human eye, V(\\lambda) from Figure 2.8 convoluted by the AM1.5 solar spectrum from Figure 2.3. The area under the curve, is a measure of brightness as perceived by a human. The numbers in the colour bar, indicate the relative contribution, as a percent, of different colours of light as defined in standard ISO 21348.\n\n\n\n\n\nCorresponding to the physical quantities of radiation summarized in Table 2.1 above, the equivalent photometric quantities are listed in the Table 2.4 below and have the subscript \\mathrm{v}. The ratio between the (physiological) luminous flux \\Phi_\\mathrm{v} and the (physical) radiant flux \\Phi is the (photopic) photometric equivalent K(\\lambda)=V(\\lambda)\\times K_m with K_m=683 lm W^{-1} (lumen per watt) at 555 nm. The dark-adapted sensitivity of the eye (scotopic vision) has its maximum at 507 nm with 1700 lm W^{-1}. The base unit of luminous intensity is candela (cd). One candela is defined as the monochromatic intensity at 555 nm with I=\\frac{1}{683} W sr^{-1}. The luminous flux of a normal candle is around 12 lm. Assuming a homogeneous emission into all directions, the luminous intensity is about I_v=\\frac{12\\;\\mathrm{lm}}{4\\pi\\;\\mathrm{sr}}\\approx 1 cd.\n\n\n\nTable 2.4: Photometric quantities.

PAR is expressed in physical units as a flux of photons of wavelengths between 400 and 700 nm. Before its widespread acceptance and the widespread availability of PAR or “quantum” light sensors, both energy and photometric quantities were frequently used in research on plants and vegetation. Very long term series of global radiation are available, while those for PAR are shorter and fewer.\nIn the case of UV radiation, different biologically effective weightings are used, mostly to describe damage or inhibition. These quantities are normally expressed using energy flux units. However, these are weighted values that do not describe an energy flux but instead a value assumed to be proportional to a response such as growth inhibition (thus based on the same approach as used for photometric quantities).\nPhotosynthetically active radiation, Caldwell’s Generalized Plant Damage spectrum or GPAS-based exposures, and several other “effective” quantities are in common use in plant research and plant production. These are described in detail in Chapter XXXXX.",

    "text": "3.1.1 Reflection\nCollimated light reflected from a mirror surface remains collimated, while its direction changes. Light reflected from a white surface is scattered, and if previously collimated, after being reflected it becomes more diffuse, i.e., it leaves the surface in multiple directions. A black surface does not reflect the incident light, it absorbs it. A clear or transparent object transmits all the light incident on its surface, similarly to reflection from mirrors and white surfaces, a clear object can scatter the light passing through it or not. Real objects share some of the properties of these theoretical objects. For example, the atmosphere is not perfectly clear and does partly scatter and partly absorb radiation, depending on the wavelength of the incoming or outgoing radiation. The same applies to water. In both cases, interactions take place as the light travels through them, as well as at the interface between media with different refractive index.\nSpecular reflection, like in a mirror, affects the angle of the beam consitently, thus, preserving the image. Diffuse reflection consists in scattered light, thus the image is not preserved, light on a white matte wall (Figure 3.1). The sum of specular and diffuse reflection is called total reflection.\nR^\\mathrm{tot} = R^\\mathrm{spcl} + R^\\mathrm{diff}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Specular and diffuse reflection source temporary fill to be replaced by figure redrawn from Gates, D (1980) Figure 8.35.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGloss\n\n\n\nGloss is assessed as specular reflectance. Depending on the type of surface, different angles of incidence for the collimated light beam are used. “Gloss meters” are frequently used in industrial quality control, but have been occasonally used to characterize the surface optical properties of individual plant leaves (add reference).\n\n\nAt the boundary between two materials with different refractive index, the direction of the light beam changes, and depending on the difference in refractive index and the angle of incidence, a varying fraction of the incident light is reflected at the interface (Figure 3.2). On a flat surface like a glass plate or polished metal surface the applicable equation is that derived from Snell’s law, which mathematically is given by\nn_1 \\times sin(\\theta_1) = n_2 \\times sin(\\theta_2)\nwhere n_1 and n_2 are the refractive indexes of two materials, such as air and glass, and \\theta_1 and \\theta_2 and the refraction angles.\nReflectance can be estimated from the difference in refractive index and the angle of incidende of the light onto the plane of the interface. Reflectance depends on the contribution of s and p polarised components.\nR_p = \\left(\\frac{n^2 \\times \\cos(\\theta) - \\sqrt{n^2 - \\sin(\\theta)^2}}\n{n^2 \\times \\cos(\\theta) +\n        \\sqrt{n^2 - \\sin(\\theta)^2}}\\right)^2\nand\nR_s = \\left(\\frac{\\cos(\\theta) - \\sqrt{n^2 - \\sin(\\theta)^2}}\n{\\cos(\\theta) +\n        \\sqrt{n^2 - \\sin(\\theta)^2}}\\right)^2\nCombining both formulas above, weighted based on the contributions of p and s components. The reflectance of a single interface can be calculated as\nR = R_p \\times f_p + R_s \\times f_s\nwith f_p + f_s = 1, for the fraction of the radiation with p and s polarization planes. Using these equations, the reflectance at a glass window in contact with air of both sides can be computed. The refractive index of air is 1 and that of glass 1.5, so reflectance for a relative refractive index of n = 1.5 is shown in Figure 3.2 simulates a single and a double interface.\nThe reflectance for two surfaces can be computed taking into account multiple back and forth reflections within the glass pane as well as its internal absorbance, or approximated ignoring them, as in Figure 3.2. For a clear glass pane the error is not too large, but for some other materials could cause significant bias in the estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Reflectance of a crown glass or acrylic pane in air as a function of the angle of incidence of light. The dark grey area under the dashed line describes the light reflected by the air to glass (or entrance) interface and the pale grey area describes the light reflected at the glass to air (or exit) interface and the solid line the sum of them. The minimum reflectance at the first interface is 4%. Computed based on a relative refractive index (n) of 1.5, ignoring the higher order reflections of light bouncing back and forth within the glass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractical examples\n\n\n\nThe fraction of the incident light reflected by the glass or plastic roof of a greenhouse depends on the angle of incidence of the light, making the orientation and inclination of the roof play an important role in determining the transmittance of daylight at different times of the day and seasons of the year.\nThe same applies to plastic films and sheets used to filter-out UV radiation in field experiments: the transmittance of the filters will vary reflecting proportionally more PAR and UV radiation when the angle of incidence of sunlight is shallower.\n\n\nThe refractive index, n, is dependent on wavelength \\lambda. How strong is this dependency, depends on the material. As the refractive index of air is n = 0, this simplifies computattions for interfaces involving air. The wavelength dependency of n_\\lambda determines the wavelength dependency of spectral reflectance, R_\\lambda, of a non-scattering surface (Figure 3.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Spectral reflectance of different materials computed from the spectral refractive index n_\\lambda for an angle of incidence of 60^\\circ away from the normal. Within each type of material n_\\lambda can vary and a result of oxydation of metal surfaces and additives and surface coatings on glass and plastic sheets.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a rough surface, different points of the receiving surface are at different angles to the light beam, thus the equations above do not apply to the angle between the light beam and the plate as a whole. In addition, inclusions like air bubbles and small particles of a material with a different n than the material matrix create additional interfaces within the plate. In all these cases, different photons are reflected at different angles, scattering the light. These are some of the properties used for making diffusive plates from clear materials. In a perfect diffuser internal absorptance A_i = 0, and half of the incoming photons exit from each face of a thin plate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefractive index\n\n\n\nThe refractive index, n, is a property of a material, but we must remember that, for example, corrosion of the surface of a metal plate, changes the material at the interface with air into an oxide. Thus, the corresponding value of n also changes. Furthermore, corrosion of a polished metal surface frequently increases roughness, and thus scattering of the reflected light can also increase.\n\n\nWhen the material does not absorb any of the photons travelling through it, i.e., its internal absorptance A_i = 0, and consequently, its internal transmittance T_i = 1, total transmittance is given by T_t = 1 - R_t, where R_t is the total reflectance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\nThe surface of a water body reflects more light when the sun is low in the sky than at noon, at least if the surface of the air-water interface is horizontal and undisturbed by waves. Waves can be expected to increase reflectance when the sun is high in the sky by changing the average angle of incidence away from the normal, but to decrease it when the sun is low in the sky by altering the average angle of incidence in the opposite direction.\nIn the absence of waves, specular reflection predominates, and how the surface looks to us depends on our position relative to the sun and clouds. With waves, how the water surface looks to us will be less dependent on our position and we will no longer recognize the reflection of clouds and the sun (Figure 3.4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Sunlight reflection from the surface of a water body depends on the angle of incidence of the sun onto the surface. In this example, bright specular reflections towards the camera are seen only for specific angles between the water surface, the sun and the camera.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany materials do absorb photons as they travel through them. The proportion of the photons incident at the surface and not reflected, i.e., entering the medium that remain at different depths in the medium depends on how many are absorbed or have deviated from their original direction of travel. Thus, absorption and scattering within a medium attenuate the light beam as photons travel through the medium, as discussed next.\n\n\n3.1.2 Attenuation\nWe use the term attenuation irrespective of whether the decrease in irradiance and radiance is due to absorption, scattering or reflection. Absorption implies that the energy is transferred to the medium causing the attenuation, while reflection and scattering as discussed above, are due to changes in the angle or direction in which light propagates. Absorption and scattering are “inherent optical processes”, because they depend on the characteristics of the material itself and are independent of the light field. In addition, re-emission of absorbed photons as fluorescence can moderate overall attenuation as well as alter the spectral composition. Bioluminiscence, emission of light by conversion of other forms of energy into light is possible, and can be important in aquatic systems. We next discuss how light interacts with a medium as it travels through it, considering absorption and scattering.\nThe number of photons absorbed, or amount of energy transferred, depends on the distance travelled within the medium, thus a gradient is created along the light path. In the simple case of a light beam normal to the boundaries of a “slice” of a non scattering material, such as a true solution in the cuvette of a spectrophotometer, the length of the path is given by the thickness of the “slice”.\nAt shallower angles of incidence, the effective path becomes longer (Figure 3.5). However, the angle used to compute the length of the path is not the angle of incidence \\alpha because refraction changes this angle into \\beta. Specular reflectance takes place symmetrically to the incidence angle, at angle \\alpha^\\prime. The value of \\beta is dependent on n, the diagram was computed for n = 1.36 (Figure 3.5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Refraction alters the angle of the beam, creating reflection but also displaces the transmitted light beam, modifying the path length. From Wiki Commons\n\n\n\nEven if continuous, we can conceptually divide media into layers to describe how light is attenuated as photons travel through them. Here we consider a layer between horizontal planes z_0 and z_1, within the matrix of the medium (Figure 3.6). Thus, we can ignore refraction and reflectance at material interfaces. The processes responsible for the changes in the radiance L(\\lambda,\\theta,\\phi) as a radiation beam travels through a material, are primarily absorption a and scattering s, where \\lambda stands for wavelength, and \\theta and \\phi are angles relative to the planes delimiting the slice.\nRadiance is not only attenuated, it can also be added to the directly transmitted beam, coming from different directions, due to elastic scattering, by which a photon changes direction but not wavelength or energy level1. An example of this is Raleigh scattering by very small particles, which causes the scattering of light in a rainbow. A further, wavelength-specific gain of radiance into the direct path is possible through inelastic processes like fluorescence, where a photon is absorbed by the material and reemitted as a photon with a longer wavelength and lower energy level, and through Raman scattering. The elastic and inelastic scattered radiances are denoted as L^E and L^I, respectively. Internal sources of radiance, L^S, like bioluminescence of biological organisms or cells contribute also to the detected radiance. The path of the light beam through a thin horizontal layer with thickness \\Delta z=z_1-z_0 is shown schematically in Figure 3.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Path of the radiance and influences of absorbing and scattering particles in a thin homogeneous horizontal layer of air or water. The layer is separated from other layers of different characteristics by boundary lines at height z_0 and z_1.\n\n\n\nPutting together the different components described above, the radiative transfer equation is obtained \\cos\\theta\\,\\frac{{\\rm d}L}{{\\rm d}z} = -(a+s)\\times L + L^E + L^I + L^S \\label{equ_rte} The dependencies of L on \\lambda, \\theta, and \\phi are omitted here for brevity. No exact analytical solution to the radiative transfer equation exists, hence it is necessary either to use numerical models or to use analytical approximations.\nThe parameters of the light field can be simulated by modelling the paths of photons, also called “ray tracing”. For an infinite number of photons, the light field parameters reach their exact values asymptotically. The advantage of numerical simulation methods is a relatively simple structure of the program, but its disadvantage is the time-consuming computation involved. Details of the application of the Monte Carlo method to simulations are explained for example by Prahl et al. (1989), Wang, Jacques, and Zheng (1995)2, or Mobley (1994).\nThe other way to solve the radiative transfer equation is through the development of analytical approximations for all the quantities needed. In this case, the result is not exact, but it has the advantage of fast computation and that the analytical equations can be inverted easily. This leads to the idealised case of a source-free (L^S=0) and non-scattering media, i.e., b=0 and therefore L^E=L^I=0. Then, equation XXXX can be integrated easily to yield\nL(z_1) = L(z_0)\\times \\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{a\\cdot(z_1-z_0)}{\\cos\\theta}}\nThe radiance value at the upper boundary, L(z_0), is presumed known. This equation is known as Beer’s law (or Lambert’s law, Bouguer’s law, Beer-Lambert law), and describes any instance of exponential attenuation of light and is exact only for purely absorbing media—i.e., media that do not scatter radiation. It is of direct application in analytical chemistry, as it describes the direct proportionality of absorbance (A) to the concentration of a “coloured” solute in a transparent solvent. True solutions are optically homogeneous, while suspensions and aerosols are not. The latter scatter light and their behaviour is different from that described by Beer’s law. In chemistry, Beer’s law is formulated in a simplified way by assuming a collimated light beam incident at 90 degrees\nI_\\lambda(z_1) = I_\\lambda(z_0) \\times \\mathrm{e}^{-k_\\lambda\\times c\\times l} where I_\\lambda(z_0) and I_\\lambda(z_1) are irradiances, k_\\lambda is the attenuation coefficient of the solute, c is the concentration of the solute, and l = z_1 - z_0 is the path length. As the value of k_\\lambda is a function of wavelength, \\lambda, how much I is attenuated also depends on \\lambda.\nThis equation can be used to compute irradiance at any point in the path by varying l if k_\\lambda and c are known. In chemical analysis, the equation is used to estimate c with k_\\lambda and l known. For a valid estimate, all the quantities must be expressed in coherent units, and the solvent should not absorb photons in the wavelength range of interest. In practice, in most cases both the pure solvent and the solution are measured, and the effect of the solute obtained by difference. A calibration curve based on a dilution series of known concentrations is safest when the pure solute is available.\nIrradiance in a solution changes with path length following an exponential attenuation curve, i.e., the curve is asymptotic (Figure 3.7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: Hypothetical light attenuation curve computed with the Beer-Lambert equation assuming k \\times c = 5. This figure illustrates the shape of the curve, while the z_i - z_0 are arbitrary path lengths l.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRadiation transfer models\n\n\n\nRadiation transfer models like TUV and libradtran simulate the modifying effect of the atmosphere on extraterrestrial solar spectral irradiance to estimate the daylight spectrum at ground level or at different elevations within the atmosphere. Importantly, these models compute the effect of the surface albedo, aerosols, clouds and particles in the atmosphere.\nThe output from both models can be either spectral irradiance or spectral radiance. They also estimate the direct and diffuse components, as well as the upwelling scattered radiation from the ground surface.\nBoth libradtran (Emde et al. 2016) and TUV models can be installed and run locally, while a simplified interactive on-line application Quick TUV Calculator is available. R package ‘photobiologyInOut’ can import data generated by these models into R objects. R package ‘forqat’ can do simulation with TUV, either locally installed or using the Quick TUV API, directly from within R.\nRadiation transfer models have also been developed for simulation of the within canopies (e.g., Chelle, Andrieu, and Bouatouch 1998; Chelle et al. 2007) and as well as within leaves, e.g. PROSPECT (Feret et al. 2008; Li et al. 2023).\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Radiation, Atoms and Molecules\nI propose here a new section, that needs to be consistent with what Wolfgang will write about related subjects.\nA pigment is a light absorbing chemical or biochemical molecule. Which wavelengths are absorbed or not is determined by the allowed energy levels and transitions because only photons with “matching” energy can be absorbed. Pigment molecules with enhanced energy states as a result of an interaction with one or more photons are said to be “excited”. The additional energy absorbed from photons can be dissipated through different excitation decay mechanisms. Excitation can also lead to conformational changes in proteins and modify their readiness to interact with other molecules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe principles of photochemistry\n\n\n\nLight is electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths to which the human eye, as well as the photosynthetic apparatus, is sensitive (\\lambda \\approx 400 to 700 nm). However, sometimes the word light is also used to refer to other nearby regions of the spectrum: ultraviolet (shorter wavelengths than visible light) and infra-red (longer wavelengths). Both particle and wave attributes of radiation are needed for a complete description of its behaviour. Light particles or quanta are called photons.\nSensing of visible and radiation by plants and other organisms starts as a photochemical event, and is ruled by the basic principles of photochemistry:\nGrotthuss law: Only radiation that is actually absorbed can produce a chemical change.\nStark-Einstein law: Each absorbed quantum activates only one molecule.\nAs electrons in molecules can have only discrete energy levels, only photons that provide a quantity of energy adequate for an electron to ‘jump’ to another possible energetic state can be absorbed. The consequence of this is that substances have colours, i.e. they absorb photons with only certain energies. See Nobel (2009) and Björn (2007) for detailed descriptions of the interactions between light and matter.\n\n\nIn the case of photoreceptors the operationally relevant mechanism is triggering a cascade of events in a transduction change, most frequently, but not only, resulting in changes in gene expression, protein localization or membrane permeability.\nFluorescence is the “decay” of part of the energy acquired through absorption of radiation, by emission of radiation of longer wavelength (photos of lower energy) (Figure 3.8). This red-shift is caused by action of competing routes for energy dissipation, such as thermal energy loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.8: The Perrin-Jablonski diagram showing energy states. The absorption of a photon is depicted together with the different pathways for energy disipation. Energy increases upwards on the vertical axis. (Modified from diagram by Germain Salvato-Vallverdu.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpectral absorptance\n\n\n\nAbsorptance, \\alpha, and absorbance, A, are wavelength dependent. We perceive this as colour. The colour of things is ultimately determined by the allowed energy states of molecules “selecting” which photons are absorbed or not, and fluorescence of which wavelength is emitted. This is because, as seen above the energy of a photon corresponds to matching wavelength, and thus, also colour.\nWhen fluorescence occurs as the result of the interaction of a molecule with a single photon, fluorescence is necessarily emitted as photons of at most slightly lower energy than the absorbed ones. There are exceptional cases when the energy gained from more than one photon drives the emission of a single photon of higher energy, and thus shorter wavelength. Obviously the flux of energy emitted as radiation remains less than that absorbed, but shared among fewer photons.\nLarge molecules like photoreceptors contain many electrons and can change in configuration after absorption of a photon. With many allowed energy states they tend to display spectra with multiple broad peaks.\n\n\nFor molecules in an ideal solution their interaction with the medium modifies the allowed energy states and thus, also their absorption spectrum, but, usually, only slightly (Figure 3.9). In this same case, of molecules in solution, it is convenient to express their ability to absorb light per mole. The IUPAC-recommended name for this property is called molecular attenuance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.9: Normalised absorbance spectrum of chlorophyll a in methanol and diethyl ether.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen light drives a photochemical reaction, the quantity quantun yield describes the reaction efficiency as the ratio between the rate at which the product molecules are pruced and the rate at which photons are being absorbed. The units are mol mol^{-1}.\nFinally it is possible to combine molecular attenuance and quantun yield to describe the rate of a photochemical reaction relative to incident radiation.\nSome ideas of what could be still\n\nDecay/quenching: thermal, fluorescence, phosphorescence\nLuminescence\nmolar cross section",

    "text": "4.1 Introduction\nMost photobiologists sooner or later have to measure light absorption by objects such as plant leaves, optical filters or solutes in a liquid medium. The physical quantities we measure may vary: absorbance, optical density, absorptance, transmittance and reflectance. For each of these quantities there is also variation in how they are defined and in the symbols used to represent them. The main authority for chemical notation is the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and as photochemistry is closely related to photobiology, IUPAC definitions are suitable and broadly used in plant physiology (Braslavsky 2007). I will use the definitions and symbols recommended by IUPAC (Cohen et al. 2007; Braslavsky 2007) and the Système international d’unités (SI units). Johnsen (2012) discusses the proliferation of units and describes a subset of them, based on the uses in his field of research, and several of the definitions he gives are not consistent with those currently recommended by IUPAC. Even if in the field of plant photobiology the IUPAC definitions are usually followed, as I will do here, researchers should be very attentive both as readers and writers about the existence of alternative definitions and the use of the same symbols for different physical quantities. In addition, some of the consistently used and named quantities can be difficult to distinguish from each other for non-experts. My aim here is to provide guidance for the use of these quantities in research on plants.",

    "text": "4.2 Reflectance\nReflectance is the fraction of the incident radiation that is reflected, \\rho = P_\\mathrm{refl} / P_0, where P_\\mathrm{refl} is the reflected radiation and P_0 the incident radiation. Simple enough, but in most cases \\rho depends on the angle of incidence of the illumination, so for \\rho to be interpretable this must be described. How we collect the reflected light also matters, giving rise to two different quantities, specular reflectance \\rho_\\mathrm{specular} and total reflectance \\rho. In the case of \\rho we usually use collimated light for illumination at only a small angle of incidence compared to normal (90^\\circ) and collect all reflected light with an integrating sphere. In this case we normally use as white reference a surface that scatters the light. In the case of \\rho_\\mathrm{specular} we use collimated light for illumination and measure reflected light from the same direction as illumination over a narrow angle. In this second case, we can take readings at different angles to describe how \\rho varies. In addition, while \\rho is defined over a broad range of wavelengths, determined by light source and sensor, if we use a light source with a wide emission spectrum and measure the reflected component with a spectrometer we obtain spectral reflectance, given by \\rho(\\lambda) = P_\\mathrm{refl}(\\lambda) / P_0(\\lambda), where \\lambda stands for wavelength.

Computations are for an interface between air and crown glass, i.e., for relative refractive index n=1.5.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a plane interface, such as that between air and a polished glass plate, the reflectance at different angles can be calculated from the refractive indexes (Figure 1.1). It depends on the relative refractive index between two media, such as air and glass. I assumed an interface with a relative refractive index of 1.5, which is close to that between crown glass or acrylic and air. If light is moving from air into the glass or acrylic, \\rho \\lesssim 0.1 for incidence angles &lt;30^\\circ and then increases rapidly reaching \\rho \\approx 0.5 at an angle of 15^\\circ and \\rho = 1 when the light beam is parallel to the surface (Figure 1.1). In most cases we are dealing with two interfaces, one on each face of the glass or acrylic pane, resulting in a further decrease in transmittance. The dependency on the angle of incidence is, obviously, important when using wavelength-selective filters but also crucial for the design of glass-houses at medium and high latitudes.\nThe same formulae apply to metals, but in the case of metals the refractive index is given a complex number with a Real component n and an imaginary component k. Reflection of diffuse, i.e., Lambertian, light at plane interfaces and reflection of collimated light by scattering media are beyond the aims of this paper.",

    "text": "4.7 Practical considerations and applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nBecause absorbance, A, is proportional to the concentration of a light-absorbing solute, A_\\mathrm{10} \\propto [\\mathrm{solute}], it is used widely in spectrophotometry. Similarly, the Dualex instruments (Force-A, Orsay) measure a quantity that approximates the absorbance of the epidermis of leaves on a band centred at \\lambda = \\mathrm{375\\,nm} (Goulas et al. 2004). This index quantity is assumed to be useful as a proxy of the concentration flavonoids in the epidermis. However, when we are interested in the degree of protection, transmittance, \\tau, is more informative than absorbance. This instrument measures the attenuation of radiation reaching the chlorophyll in the leaf mesophyll by comparing the excitation of chlorophyll fluorescence by radiation of different wavelengths. The conversion of A(\\lambda = 375\\,\\mathrm{nm}) into \\tau(\\lambda = 375\\,\\mathrm{nm}) is straighforward. As \\tau = 10^{-A_\\mathrm{10}}, it follows that a value of A_\\mathrm{epidermis} = 2 from the Dualex can be interpreted as meaning that \\approx1\\% of the UVA at \\lambda \\approx \\mathrm{375\\,nm} impinging on the epidermis reaches the mesophyll and \\approx99\\% is attenuated. Because of the way the Dualex works, comparing two wavelengths, only the difference in epidermal reflectance between \\lambda \\approx \\mathrm{375\\,nm} and \\lambda \\approx \\mathrm{655\\,nm} is measured and consequently the A estimate from the Dualex is not a true absorbance neither a true optical density, \\mathrm{OD}, estimate but instead something in-between. This must be taken into consideration when discussing protection for leaves that are highly reflective in the visible, because true UVA protection will be significantly better than that estimated by Dualex instruments.\n\n\nDepending on the aims of a study, or the problem at hand, \\rho, \\tau, \\alpha, A or \\mathrm{OD} may be the most informative quantity. Depending on the object measured and equipment used, \\tau or \\tau may be easier to obtain. In many cases by default or as only option an instrument may provide values for a quantity that is not the one most appropriate. In such cases, the relationships and equations described above may allow us to convert the measured values (see, Box [box:hints1]).\nIf we measure a solution in a cuvette with a spectrophotometer and we use as reference the same or an identical cuvette with solvent as reference, we can assume that we have discounted the effect of reflections. Instead if we measure a filter, such as a piece of polyester film, and the reference is no film, our measurement includes the effect of reflections at the film surface. If we express the readings as transmittance, in the first case we have measured \\tau_\\mathrm{internal} while in the second cases \\tau (total). If we use logs then we obtain absorbance A and optical density \\mathrm{OD}, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Effect of celullose diacetate film thickness on total transmittance.\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal transmittance, \\tau_\\mathrm{internal}, makes it easy to compute the effect of changes in transmission with changes in the length of the light pass, such as different spectrophotometer cuvettes of ionic filter glass thickness. This is easy to understand from first principles: \\rho in non-scattering media is defined by the surface, so \\rho is not affected by the thickness of the material. That in the formula below we use the ratio between the thicknesses of the filter material as an exponent, stems from the exponential extinction relationship described by the Lambers-Beer law. \\tau_\\mathrm{internal, d2} = \\tau_\\mathrm{internal, d1}^{(d1/d2)}, where \\mathrm{d1} is the thickness corresponding to the known \\tau_\\mathrm{d1} and \\mathrm{d2} the thickness for which we want to compute the corresponding \\tau_\\mathrm{d2}. Figure [fig:aphaloabs2] shows measurements of transmittance for cellulose diacetate. Increasing the thickness four times alters the shape of the curve and shifts the wavelength for 50% transmittance by 8.6 nm towards longer wavelength and decreases the UVA transmittance by 20%.\nIf we compare a standard spectrophotometer cuvette with 10 mm light path to a cuvette with a path of 50 mm, a solution that yields A = 0.2 in the first cuvette will yield A = 0.2 \\cdot 5 = 1.0 in the second cuvette. When we need to measure very low concentrations using a longer light path is very useful and using a short light path helps when concentrations are high. Cuvettes with light-paths lengths bewteen 1  mm and 100 mm are easily available, an can greatly increase the range of concentrations that can be measured with a given instrument, as long as they physically fit into the spectrophotometer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen using opposing integrating spheres like in the SpectroClip-TR (Ocean Insight, Dunedin, FL, formerly Ocean Optics), an important problem is created. Part of the transmitted photons will bounce on the lower integrating sphere impinging onto the lower surface of the object and may be transmitted back through the object into the upper sphere. This means that some photons will contribute to both the transmittance and reflectance measurements, which can result in erroneous measurements that seem to indicate that \\rho + \\tau + \\alpha \\geq 1. The problem affects more those samples with high values of \\tau. For example, in spectral measurements of leaves in the far-red region (\\lambda \\gtrsim 700\\,\\mathrm{nm}) \\alpha is very small and \\tau nearly 50%, a situation where unless a black object is put behind the leaf during the measurement of \\rho, the estimate of \\rho will be biased towards values larger than the true ones. It is also possible to apply a correction when processing the data. For the data in Figure 1 a black object was put behind the leaf during the measurement of \\rho, and the minimum calculated \\alpha(\\lambda) was very close to zero. The best light absorber that is easily available and thin, is the black flocking sold for covering the inside of optical instruments and cameras (Arax, Kiev; https://araxfoto.com/) or special black paint for this same purpose such as Kameralack Spray (Tetenal, Norderstedt; https://www.tetenal.com/) sprayed on a suitable base material. Not being aware of the limitations introduced by the Spectro Clip’s design can lead to substantially wrong data being reported.\n\n\nIn the first part of this section we have considered only non-scattering materials. This is the simplest case because if we measure in a normal spectrophotometer a non-scattering material like an homogeneous solution or a piece of glass or acrylic with well polished surfaces estimates of \\tau will be reliable as the light beam direction will not be disturbed. In contrast, if we measure a suspension of particles in a solvent or a thick film of polythene or similar plastic, we will grossly underestimate \\tau. The reason is simple, the transmitted light that is no longer collimated will not reach the sensor and will not be measured. In this case, to obtain a reliable measurement, we need to use an integrating sphere to collect the photons leaving the measured object in all possible directions. The obvious way to recognize that scattering is biasing the measurements is to look at the measured transmittance at wavelengths were the material is known to have very high transmittance such as the visible region for polythene. If the measured transmittance is less than 0.9, then the measurement has been biased by the scattering and wrong. Of course, unless scattering is minimal, we can also see its effect when looking through the materials. Depending on how the integrating spheres are attached to the sample, additional complications may arise (see, Box [box:hints2]).\nIn the previous examples in this section we have considered objects that attenuate irradiance mainly through absorption of light that travels through them. There are filters that attenuate light through selective reflection, with such filters thickness of the base material only minimally affects transmittance, i.e., \\alpha \\ll \\rho. Interference filters are produced by deposition of very think layers on the surface of the substrate and \\rho(\\lambda) is controlled by their thickness. The opposite effect is also possible, and is used to produce anti-reflection (AR) coatings in glass and plastic filters and windows. AR multi-coating (MC) can achieve \\rho &lt; 0.5\\% over the whole visible region. If we “stack” filters of either type, as long as air gaps remain between them, they can be thought as “functioning independently” of each other.\nTo estimate \\tau(\\lambda) for such a stack of filters separated by air gaps, we need to convolute the spectra—i.e., we need to multiply them wavelength by wavelength. The stacking order is in theory and frequently also in reality irrelevant—i.e., it is transitive as for multiplication in algebra: \\tau_{1+2}(\\lambda) = \\tau_1(\\lambda) \\times \\tau_2(\\lambda). In the case of absorbances we have to add them instead because of the log transformation: A_{1+2}(\\lambda) = A_1(\\lambda) + A_2(\\lambda).\nNormally transmittance is measured for a light beam impinging on the surface of a filter at 90^\\circ. However, the angle of incidence can affect in various ways light attenuation. We will first consider \\tau_\\mathrm{internal} and how the length of the light path through the filter depends on the angle of incidence of the light beam. If we discount the effect of refraction at the air-filter interfaces, and assume the direction of the beam remains the same inside the filter, we can use sinple trigonometry to compute the approximate path length. As an example we will consider the spectral transmittance of polyester 0.125 mm-thick, and that the sun will shine on it at 90^\\circ at noon but at 23^\\circ later in the afternoon. This is a difference of 62^\\circ, corresponding to a doubling in the path length.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Effect of the angle of incidence on the internal transmittance of polyester film 0.125,mm-thick. See Appendix for code used.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove I mentioned that reflectance, \\rho, depends on the angle of incidence, and it increases at shallower angles of incidence. So this two effects add up. The angle between the solar beam and the filters tend to be only infrequently explicitly considered when designing light filtration experiments. Although the path length may not have a huge effect for good quality glass or acrylic, reflection will decrease PAR even for clear materials. In the case of reflective or interference filters which wavelengths are transmitted and which reflected, depends on the angle of incidence, so spectral transmittance in specifications is given at a specific angle of incidence. Usually this angle is normal to the surface, but some filters, in particular many of those reflecting infrared radiation, or hot mirrors, are designed to be installed at other angles, such as 45^\\circ so that the thermal radiation is not reflected back towards the light source but instead to the side.\n\n4.7.1 Quantities Describing Light-Matter Interactions\nRadiation incident on an object can be partitioned into three components based on its fate,\n1 = R^\\mathrm{tot} + \\alpha + T^\\mathrm{tot} where R^\\mathrm{tot}, \\alpha, and T^\\mathrm{tot} are expressed as fractions Table 4.1. Alternatively, they can be expressed as percentages.\nIf I_0 is the irradiance on the surface of an object, the “irradiance” entering the body of the object is given by I_0 \\times (1 - R^\\mathrm{tot}). The irradiance exiting the opposite side of the object is given by I_0 \\times T^\\mathrm{tot}.\nInternal transmittance T^\\mathrm{int} considers only the radiation entering the object, thus,\n1 = \\alpha + T^\\mathrm{int} from which it follows that always T^\\mathrm{int} \\geq T^\\mathrm{tot}. To convert T^\\mathrm{int} into T^\\mathrm{tot} we need to know R^\\mathrm{tot},\nT^\\mathrm{tot} = T^\\mathrm{int} \\times (1 - R^\\mathrm{tot}) and T^\\mathrm{int} = \\frac{T^\\mathrm{tot}}{1 - R^\\mathrm{tot}}\nAbsorbance (A) is a logarithm-transformed quantity. In Chemistry A is most frequently computed using base-10 logarithm, while is some other fiels natural or e-based logarithms are used.\nA = -\\log_{10}(1 - \\alpha) = -\\log_{10}(T^\\mathrm{int}) = -\\log_{10}(R^\\mathrm{tot} + T^\\mathrm{tot})\nWe use A as symbol for decadic absorbance, for which A_{10} may be used in other publications. We use the subscript to indicate the wavelength in nanometres (nm), e.g., A_{663}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nAs discussed earlier in this chapter, in the Beer-Lambert equation solute concentration enters as an exponent, i.e., a power of e. Thus, A \\propto c, and a convenient quantity for assessing concentrations of a solute as c = A \\times k where k is the slope of an empirical calibration curve.\nIn chemistry and biochemistry when using a spectrophotometer it is the norm to measure a blank as reference. The assumption is that R^\\mathrm{tot} is the same for the blank and the sample, thus the difference between blank and sample, corresponds to absorptance, \\alpha, or 1 - T^\\mathrm{int}. As the solvent is used for the blank, the difference in absorptance can be attributed to the solute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.1: Physical quantities that describe the interaction of objects and light and related quantities describing intensive properties of materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nUnit\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nR^\\mathrm{tot}\nfraction\nTotal reflectance:\n\n\nR^\\mathrm{spcl}\nfraction\nSpecular reflectance:\n\n\nR^\\mathrm{diff}\nfraction\nDiffuse reflectance:\n\n\nn\nnumeric\nRefractive index:\n\n\nT^\\mathrm{tot}\nfraction\nTotal transmittance:\n\n\nT^\\mathrm{int}\nfraction\nInternal transmittance:\n\n\n\\alpha\nfraction\nAbsorptance:\n\n\nA\na.u.\nAbsorbance:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAphalo, Pedro J. 2020. “Absorbance, Absorptance and Friends.” UV4Plants Bulletin 2020 (1): 45–60. https://doi.org/10.19232/uv4pb.2020.1.12.\n\n\nBjörn, Lars Olof, ed. 2007.

    "text": "4.1.1 Position of the sun\nWhen studying plants we frequently need to describe the position of the sun because of its effect on spectral irradiance and as a determinant of day length. The azimuth angle (\\phi) is usually measured clockwise from the North on a horizontal plane. The position on the vertical plane is measured either as the zenith angle (\\theta) downwards from the zenith, or as an elevation angle (h) upwards from the horizon. Consequently h + \\theta = 90^\\circ = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\,radians. When describing the position of the sun as in Figure 4.1 the observer is situated at the origin of the system of coordinates used to describe the angles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Diagram showing the angles used to describe the position of the sun in the sky, viewed from the East. h: sun elevation angle, θ: zenith angle, Φ: azimuth angle.\n\n\n\nThe daily path of the sun in the sky depends on the time of the year and the latitude. The time of solar noon depends on the actual geographic location, and nearly always differs from the local-time noon which is based on a time zone and possibly affected by a shift of one or more hours to enhance daylight use, especially in summer time.\nHighly accurate astronomical formulas are available and can be used to compute the current, past and future positions of the sun in the sky (e.g., Meeus 1998). Less accurate, but simpler to compute, formulas also exist. These formulas can also be use to compute day- and night lengths based on different twilight definitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe accuracy of astronomical formulas is less when the sun is near the horizon because, as seen in the previous chapter, the transition from vacuum to the atmosphere introduces a small angular displacement of the light beam depending on the refractive index and angle of incidence. The difficulty is that the refractive index (\\nu) of the air depends on its water content, which is not constant.\n\n\nThe path of the sun in the sky determines the lengths of the day and night. The most frequently used criterion for the day to night and night to days transitions is that the upper rim of the solar disk coincides with the astronomical horizon. As the solar disk is approximately 2 degrees in diameter, the transition between day and night is in this case when the centre of the solar disk is one degree below the horizon. Alternatively, the centre of the solar disk can be used coinciding with the astronomical horizon can be used as the criterion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Position of the sun at sunrise, sunset, dawn and dusk. Figure by TWCarlson available at Wikimedia Commons under CC-BY-SA 3.0.\n\n\n\nTwilight is the period before sunrise and after sunset when there is more intense diffuse light than further into the night (Figure 4.2). The definitions of twilight are based on practical considerations of human activities, and called civil, naval and astronomical (Figure 4.3). During civil twilight artificial lighting is usually not needed in cities. For nautical twilight I have seen two descriptions: 1) before nautical dawn and after nautical dawn it is possible to navigate based on the stars, and 2) after nautical dawn and before nautical dusk navigation by sight is possible. Before astronomical dawn and after astronomical dusk stars of sixth magnitude are visible. These three descriptions are very approximate, as they do not consider the effect of clouds, light pollution from artificial sources, or other source of light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Criteria defining twilight based on the position of the sun. The angles when expressed as sun elevation (h) are negative. Only dawn and sunrise shown. The same angles are used between sunset and dusk. Figure by TWCarlson available at Wikimedia Commons under CC-BY-SA 3.0., edited\n\n\n\nThe day length through the year computed for three cities, one of them, Ivalo at the northern latitude within the Artic circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Day length through the year at different latitudes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we include twilight, the estimated length of the photoperiod increases (Figure 4.5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Photoperiod duration computed for sunrise/sunset or for dawn/dusk according to different twilight definitions. The curve describes the elevation angle of the sun through the day at Helsinki, Finalnd, on the 21 March 2024. The horizontal lines show the elevation angles used as the boundary of the “photoperiod” and the numbers above each of these lines give the corresponding length of the photoperiod in hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nEven though day length or photoperiod duration is normally based on the astronomical horizon, in many cases there are obstacles that occlude the sun from view until later at dawn or earlier at dusk: mountains, vegetation, buildings, etc. Thus, in some cases it may be more relevant for a scientific study with plants to consider sun elevation angles h &gt; 0 as the criterion; even different angles can be used for day start and day end.\nThe question remains of what light level is actually detected by plants and other organisms as the night-day and day-night transitions. Most likely the exact value depends on the genotype and the realized phenotype. However, at dawn and dusk irradiance increases and decreases, respectively, qquite fast at low and medium latitudes. At high latitudes, at some times the year twilight lasts for a long time making the change in irradiance more gradual. At civil dawn/dusk irradiance is already very low.\n\n\nThe dependency of the elevation angle on time of the year and latitude is illustrated in Figure 4.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: Sun elevation angle through the day at five different latitudes and four dates. The horizontal dotted lines show the horizon (h = 0). The range limits for the x and y axes are consistent across all plots.\n\n\n\n\n\nThree images from fig 3.6 in Graedel and Crutzen, 1993. Scanned. Have to be redrawn.\n  \nAdd links to previous chapter\n\n\n4.1.2 Solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere\nWe can measure irradiance outside the atmosphere at a know distance from the sun and we can also measure the apparent diameter of the sun at this same distance. Based on this we can calculate the total radiant energy emitted by the sun and irradiance at arbitrary distances.\nIn outer space, in vacuum, no scattering takes place as the light travels, and because of this, the sky looks completely black. Planets and the Moon do reflect light allowing us to see them. As the distance to the sun increases irradiance decreases as the flux spreads into a large area represented by the surface of a sphere, without scattering, this becomes a geometric computations in 3D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometric calculation\n\n\n\nThe spectral irradiance of the sun {E_{\\mathrm{s}}}(\\lambda) can be estimated assuming a homogeneous flux and using the correlation of intensity and radiance from their definitions in table [tab:Phys:Quants]. The intensity of the sun {I_{\\mathrm{s}}}(\\lambda) is given by the radiance {L_{\\mathrm{s}}}(\\lambda) multiplied by the apparent sun surface (a non-tilted disk of radius r_s=7\\times 10^5 km). To calculate the decreased solar irradiance at the top of the Earth’s atmosphere, the distance of the sun to the Earth (r_0=150\\times 10^6 km) has to be taken into account applying the inverse square law of irradiance of equation ([equ_r2law]). Thus, the extraterrestrial solar irradiance is\n{E_{\\mathrm{s}}}(\\lambda)={L_{\\mathrm{s}}}(\\lambda)\\cdot\\frac{\\pi r_s^2}{r_0^2} Remembering the solid angle of equation ([equ_solidangle]), the right multiplication factor represents the solid angle of the sun’s disk as seen from the Earth’s surface (\\approx 6.8\\times 10^{-5} sr).\n\n\nAt the time scales relevant to plants and humans, the distance between the Sun and the Earth varies little, as well as the emission from the surface of the sun. Thus, we can use a “solar constant” as a useful and nearly perfect approximation. The solar “constant”, the irradiance at the top of the atmosphere, varies between 1\\,361 and 1\\,362~\\mathrm{W m^{-2}} due to changes in solar activity. In addition to the irradiance, the shape of the solar spectrum at the top of the atmosphere varies very little in time, and is usually assumed constant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRadiation from the sun reaches the Earth’s surface in about eight minutes (t = time, r_0 = distance sun to earth, c = velocity of light in vacuum): t = \\frac{r_0}{c} \\approx \\frac{150 \\times 10^9 ~{\\rm m}}{3 \\times 10^8 ~\\frac{\\rm m}{\\rm s}} = 500 ~{\\rm s} = 8.3 ~{\\rm min}.\n\n\nThe energy radiance (L) of radiation emitted by the sun is similar in shape, but not identical, to the emission spectrum of a black body. The solar spectrum has a fine structure of peaks and valleys arising from the atoms and molecules in the sun while black body emission is described by a smooth curve. A “match” based on the wavelength at which spectral energy radiance is at its maximum can be used as criterion to estimate the temperature of the sun’s surface. Obviously, we use the extraterrestrial spectrum for this match. We see in the AM0 curve in Figure 4.11 that the wavelength at the maximum is near 500 nm. In reality the temperature of the sun surface is not uniform, and different sources mention as its average temperatures between 5800 K and 5500 K. Comparing the AM0 curve in Figure 4.11 to the 5800 K curve in Figure 4.7 the similary of their shapes is clear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: Radiance spectra for black bodies at three different temperatures; 5800 K (blue), 5000 K (orange) and 3700 K (red).\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanck’s law describes black body emission at temperature T (Figure 4.7), expressed as absolute temperature measured in degrees Kelvin (K):\nL_s(\\lambda,T) = \\frac{2hc^2}{\\lambda^5}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{e}^{(hc/k_\\mathrm{B}T\\lambda)}-1}\nwith Boltzmann’s constant k_\\mathrm{B}=1.381\\times 10^{-23} .\nThe “equivalent temperature” of a black body is given by Wien’s displacement law (Figure 4.8), which gives the wavelength at which the radiative energy emitted by a black body is at its maximum as a function of its absolute temperature.\n\\lambda_\\mathrm{max} \\cdot T = 2.898 \\times 10^6 \\,{\\rm nm\\,K}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.8: The peak wavelength of radiation emission by a black body as a function of its absolute (surface) temperature. The approximate temperature of the sun T_\\mathrm{sun} \\approx 5800\\,\\mathrm{K} is highlighted by a yellow-filled circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThe concept of “colour temperature” used for describing the emission of lamps used for illumination and more generaly in photography differs in that it takes into account human colour vision when determining the match between the black body emission spectrum and the spectrum of an arbitrary light source. The coordinated colour temperature (CCT) for the AM1.5 solar spectrum is 5231 K and for the AM0 spectrum is 5922 K.\n\n\nThe spectral irradiance of the sun {E_{\\mathrm{s}}}(\\lambda) can be estimated assuming a homogeneous flux and using the correlation of intensity and radiance from their definitions in table [tab:Phys:Quants]. The intensity of the sun {I_{\\mathrm{s}}}(\\lambda) is given by the radiance {L_{\\mathrm{s}}}(\\lambda) multiplied by the apparent sun surface (a non-tilted disk of radius r_s=7\\times 10^5 km). To calculate the decreased solar irradiance at the moment of reaching the Earth’s atmosphere, the distance of the sun to the Earth (r_0=150\\times 10^6 km) has to be taken into account due to the inverse square law of irradiance of equation ([equ_r2law]). Thus, the extraterrestrial solar irradiance is\n{E_{\\mathrm{s}}}(\\lambda)={L_{\\mathrm{s}}}(\\lambda)\\cdot\\frac{\\pi r_s^2}{r_0^2}\\label{equ_extraterrestrial} Remembering the solid angle of equation ([equ_solidangle]), the right multiplication factor represents the solid angle of the sun’s disk as seen from the Earth’s surface (\\approx 6.8\\times 10^{-5} sr). Figure [fig_sun] shows the spectrum of the measured extraterrestrial solar radiation (Wehrli, 1985)1 and the spectrum calculated by equation 1.14 using Planck’s law of equation 1.12 at a black body temperature of 5800 K. Integrated over all wavelengths, {E_{\\mathrm{s}}} is about 1361 to 1362 at top of the atmosphere (Kopp and Lean 2011). This value is called the ‘solar constant’. In former times, depending on different measurements, {E_{\\mathrm{s}}} varies by a few percent (Iqbal 1983). For example, the irradiance at the top of the atmosphere (the integrated value) changes by \\pm 50 (3.7 %) during the year due to distance variation caused by orbit excentricity (Mobley 1994). More accurate measurements during the last 25 years by spaceborne radiometers show a variability of the solar radiation of a few tenth of a percent. A detailed analysis is given by Fröhlich and Lean (2004). {E_{\\mathrm{s}}} can also be calculated by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: the total energy emitted from the surface of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature. For an isotropically emitting source (Lambertian emitter), this means {L_{\\mathrm{}}}= \\frac{\\sigma}{\\pi} \\cdot T^4 \\label{equ_boltzmann} with the Stefan-Boltzmann constant \\sigma=5.6705\\times 10^{-8} W m^{-2} K^{-4}. With T = 5800 K equation [equ_boltzmann] gives the radiance of the solar disc. From this value, we can obtain an approximation of the solar constant, by taking into account the distance from the Earth to the Sun and the apparent size of the solar disc (see equations [equ_solidangle] and [equ_r2law]).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.9: The extraterrestrial solar spectrum compared to black body emission. The black body emission spectrum has been scaled to match the energy irradiance of the solar spectrum at the top of the atmosphere (AM0) within the range of wavelengths shown.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total solar irradiance covers a wide range of wavelengths. Using some of the ‘colours’ introduced in table [tab:Waverange], table [tab_sun] lists the irradiance and fraction of {E_{\\mathrm{s}}} of different wavelength intervals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWaveband\nWavelength \\lambda (nm)\nIrradiance {E_{\\mathrm{}}} (W m^{-2})\nIrradiance {E_{\\mathrm{}}} (%)\n\n\n\n\nUV-C\n100 – 280\n7\n0.5\n\n\nUV-B\n280 – 315\n17\n1.3\n\n\nUV-A2\n315 – 340\n21\n1.6\n\n\nUV-A1\n340 – 400\n63\n4.7\n\n\nPhR\n400 – 700\n531\n39.6\n\n\nIR-A (CIE)\n700 – 1400\n517\n38.6\n\n\nIR-B (CIE)\n1400 – 3000\n184\n13.7\n\n\nTOTAL\n\n1339\n100.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Solar radiation at ground level\nAbove, we used the word light with its everyday meaning. Its technical definition is of radiation visible to humans. Ultraviolet, visible and infrared radiation (taken together are called in meteorolgy shortwave radiation) are components of solar radiation.\n\n4.1.3.1 Spectrum under clear sky\nWe could include a plot of scalar spectral irradiance (easy to generate with TUV) or of hemispherical spectral irradiance measured with a hemispherical diffuser (I have data). A comparison to spectral irradiance on a horizontal plane could be very informative.\nBefore reaching the Earth’s surface radiation from the sun travels through the atmosphere. The sun elevation angle affects the length of the path that the light arriving from the sun travels through the atmosphere. In atmospheric physics it is common to describe spectra as corresponding to AM0 for above the atmosphere, AM1 when the sun is at the zenith, i.e., one atmosphere thickness and AM1.5 when the length of the air mass traversed is 1.5 times that when the sun is at the zenith.\nThe air mass traversed is, in reality, not exactly proportional to the distance computed by trigonometry, but not far from it. An empirical formula (Kasten and Young 1989) can be used as a better approximation to the computation of AM values from the elevation angle (h) (Figure 4.10).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.10: Plot of the empirical relationship between sun elevation (h) or zenith anglr (\\theta) and “equivalent” atmosphere thickness traversed by solar radiation between outer space and the Earth’s surface (at sea level). AM1 is indicated by the horizontal dotted line.\n\n\n\n\n\nLight when travelling through the atmosphere interacts with the gases and particles composing it. The light is attenuated and scattered. Different wavelengths are differently affected by these processes, giving us a blue sky and warmer coloured direct sunlight. In other words, the daylight spectrum depends on the position of the sun in the sky, and on the composition of the atmosphere along this path (Figure 4.11 and Figure 4.12). In addition to molecular absorption and scattering, aerosols, both liquid like water and solid like ice and dust, interact with light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.11: The spectrum of solar radiation above the atmosphere (AM0) and a typical spectrum at ground level (AM1.5). Spectral energy irradiance for the wavelength range called shortwave radiation in meteorology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.12: The spectrum of solar radiation above the atmosphere (AM0) and a typical spectrum at ground level (AM1.5). Spectral photon irradiance for the range 250 to 900 nm.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe extraterrestrial solar spectrum differs from that at ground level due to the absorption of radiation by the atmosphere, because the absorption peaks of water, and other components of the atmosphere, cause corresponding valleys to appear in the solar spectrum at ground level. The solar spectrum has a much finer structure, due to emission and absorption lines of elements, this fine structure is not observable with the spectroradiometers normally used in plant research. For plant research, finr structure of peaks and valleys is considered irrelevant because plant pigments in vivo have broader peaks and valleys in their spectra.\nNot only total irradiance, but also the wavelength distribution and the diffuse fraction of the solar spectrum changes with the seasons of the year and time of day. This changes are in large part explained by the change in sun elevation. In what follows we describe these changes as a function of sun elevation. The increasing air mass traversed with decreasing sun elevation affects the shape of the spectrum, by stronger attenuation of the shorter wavelengths. An increased air mass also increases scattering in the atmosphere.\nA figure of spectral irradiance is difficult to read as both the shape of the curve and the maximum spectral irradiance change in parallel Figure 4.13.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.13: Change in spectral irradiance with sun elevation angle. Based on simulations with the TUV model for an ozone column of 300 DU under clear sky.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we rescale the curves to equal PAR irradiance the change in shape is easier to observe Figure 4.14.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.14: Change in scaled spectral irradiance with sun elevation angle.

UV-B irradiance decreases faster with decreasing sun elevation (h).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.16: Change in irradiance with sun elevation angle for different regions of the spectrum. PAR. orange, UVA-1. violet, UV-A2. purple, and UV-B. black. Based on simulations with the TUV model for an ozone column of 300 DU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3.2 Diffuse fraction under clear sky\nAt the Earth’s surface, the incident radiation or global radiation has two distinct components, direct radiation and diffuse radiation. Direct radiation is radiation travelling directly from the sun, while diffuse radiation is that scattered by the atmosphere. Diffuse radiation is what gives the blue colour to the sky and white colour to clouds. The relative contribution of direct and diffuse radiation to global radiation varies with wavelength and weather conditions. The contribution of diffuse radiation is more in the UV region, and in the presence of clouds (Figures [fig:sky:photos] and [fig:diffuse:UV]).\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nSimultaneous spectral measurements of direct and diffuse solar radiation are infrequent. Radiation transfer models such as TUV estimate these components, as shown in Figure 4.17. The diffuse fraction is larger at shorter wavelengths. Under overcast conditions or any other situation when the solar disk is fully occluded the diffuse fraction is equal to one. However, only in outer space the diffuse fraction approaches zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.17: Spectral energy irradiance under a clear sky and sun elevation of 45 degrees. Simulation with the TUV radiation transfer and atmospheric chemistry model for an ozone column on 300 DU, assuming a low optical density of aerosols. The black line shown total spectral energy irradiance, the orange-filled area is the direct component and the blue-filled area is the diffuse or scattered component.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 4.17 the spectrum at a single sun elevation is shown. In Figure 4.18 the diffuse fraction from simulations under the same atmospheric conditions are shown as a function of sun elevation. The diffuse fraction is largest for shorter wavelengths and for each waveband it increases as the sun elevation decreases. This change is not linear, and has a similar shape as the change in air mass traversed Figure 4.10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.18: Fraction of total radiation that is diffuse under a clear sky as a function of sun elevation angle. PAR, orange dashed; Red, red; Green, green; Blue, blue; UVA-1, violet; UV-A2, purple; UV-B, black. Based on simulations with the TUV radiation transfer and atmospheric chemistry model for an ozone column on 300 DU, assuming a low optical density of aerosols.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3.3 Ozone column\nThe spectral wavelength distribution is also modified by the amount of ozone in the atmosphere, known as the ozone column and measured in Dobson units (DU = mm of pure ozone) Figure 4.20. As expected, it is also affected by the air mass traversed, which depends on sun elevation. The UV-B:PAR photon ratior is more strongly dependent on the thickness of the ozone column at low sun elevations, when the ratio it smallest Figure 4.20.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate change and ozone depletion\n\n\n\nAn increase in the UV-B and UV-A2 irradiance is caused by depletion of the ozone layer in the stratosphere, mainly as a consequence of the release of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), used in cooling devices such as refrigerators and air conditioners, and in some spray cans (see Graedel and Crutzen 1993). The most dramatic manifestation of this has been the seasonal formation of an “ozone hole” over Antarctica. It is controversial whether a true ozone hole has already formed in the Arctic, but strong depletion has occurred in year 2011 (Manney et al. 2011) and atmospheric conditions needed for the formation of a “deep” ozone hole are not very different from those prevalent in recent years. Not so dramatic, but consistent, depletion has also been observed at mid-latitudes in both hemispheres. CFCs and some other halocarbons have been phased out following the Montreal agreement and later updates. However, as CFCs have a long half life in the atmosphere, of the order of 100 years, their effect on the ozone layer will persist for many years, even after their use has been drastically reduced. Model-based predictions of changes in atmospheric circulation due to global climate change have been used to derive future trends in index and ozone column thickness (Hegglin and Shepherd 2009). In addition, increased cloudiness and pollution, could lead to decreased global irradiance, sometimes called ‘global dimming’ (e.g. Stanhill and Cohen 2001).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.19: Change in scaled spectral irradiance with sun elevation angle.

Data from Anders Lindfors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3.4 Clouds\nAbove we have ignored the effects of clouds and relied heavily on simulations for clear-sky conditions. Next we will consider the effect of clouds and use as examples measurements and simulations that include the effect of clouds. We will consider variation at different time scales. We start with a time series of hourly mean spectra for one day, scaled to equal PAR photon irradiance to illustrate how the shape of the spectrum can change during the course of day Figure 4.21.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.21: Time series of scaled spectral photon irradiance during one day. Hourly mean spectra scaled to PAR = 1000 \\mu mol\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-2} to emphasize the change in shape. Simulated with libradtran including the effect of clouds for Kumpula, Helsinki, Finland. Data from Andes Lindfors.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that, through reflection, broken clouds can locally increase irradiance to values above those under clear-sky conditions (Frederick et al. 1993; Díaz et al. 1996). These are transient increases of short duration and easily detected with fast measurements, and the irradiance increase can be 30% or more compared to under a clear sky. This is well illustrated by measurements at 1 min interval during four consecutive days Figure 4.22.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.22: Time course of PAR, UV-A and UV-B photon irradiance during four consecutive days with different cloud conditions. Measured with broad band-sensors at Viikki, Helsinki, Finland. The values plotted are 1 min means from measurements once every 5 s. The step changes at very low sun elevations are caused by shading from far-away buildings.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe photon ratios for the same four days Figure 4.23 shows the influence of clouds and of sun elevation, both affecting the PAR diffuse fraction. In particular, broken clouds on 10 July cause momentary nearly doubling of the UV-A:PAR and UV-B:PAR photon ratios. The short-term effect on the R:FR is smaller, but the differences between days larger, possibly because of its dependence on the atmospheric water content (kotilainenxxxx?).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.23: Time course of red:far-red, UV-A:PAR and UV-B:PAR photon ratios during four consecutive days with different cloud conditions. Measured with broad band-sensors at Viikki, Helsinki, Finland. The values plotted are 1 min means from measurements once every 5 s; data shown for sun above the horizon. The step changes at very low sun elevations are caused by shading from far-away buildings. The PAR diffuse ratio varies with sun elevation in the range 0.12 to 1.0, as shown in Figure 4.18 for clear sky conditions. With the solar disk fully occluded by clouds or objects the diffuse ratio approches 1 at all sun elevations.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 4.23 we can see fast changes in the ratios towards the end of the day. The time-series of spectra measured once a minute during 5 minutes shows how the shape of the spectrum can rapidly change leading to rapid changes in the R:FR photon ratio Figure 4.24.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.24: Time series of spectra near sunset. Five minutes of solar spectra measurements. Measured with an array spectrometer at Viikki, Helsinki, Finland.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe low irradiance periods interspersed with higher irradiance ones, caused by moving clouds intermittently occluding the sun, or cloud flecks, have a haphazard dynamics that is very dependent on the cloud type and wind conditions. One way of describing them is by estimating an empirical probability density function for their duration Figure 4.25. The distribution is not Normal, and skewed to the right. Semi-transparent and small clouds attenuate irradiance less that large thick clouds and at the same time create cloud flecks of shorter duration Figure 4.25.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.25: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. In the main panel a quantile regression is shown, with the line repesenting the median, the dark band enclosing the two central quantiles (simmilar to the box in a box plot) and the pale band enclosing 90% of the observations. The inset shows the fitted empirical density function (EDF) for the duration of the cloudflecks. Source Sellaro et al. (2024).\n\n\n\n\n\nIrradiance is much lower under cloud cover than in full sunlight under a clear sky Figure 4.26. The cloud light spectrum is shifted towards shorter wavelengths, i.e., shade light is bluer (or cooler) than full sunlight, more easily seen after scaling the spectra to equal irradiance Figure 4.26. For this example the coordinated colour temperature (CCT) was 6190 K and 5580 K for the overcast and clear sky, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.26: Spectra during and immediately after a cloudfleck. A: photon spectral irradiance as measured, B: same data scaled to equal PAR of 1\\,000 \\mu mol\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-2}. Source Sellaro et al. (2024).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3.5 Elevation\nWe have three options: 1) generate suitable data with TUV, 2) show measured data from the literature, or 3) both.\nA simulation with the TUV model shows how attenuation by the atmosphere decreases with increasing ground altitude under a clear sky, with all other parameters kept unchanged, including surface albedo. As above, we show the actual spectral irradiance and the spectral irradiances scaled to equal PAR photon irradiance. The effect is not huge and the decrease in attenuation is stronger at shorter wavelengths Figure 4.27.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.27: Spectra under clear sky and a sun elevation of 45 degrees at different ground altitudes. A: photon spectral irradiance as computed with the TUV model, B: same data scaled to equal PAR of 1\\,000 \\mu mol\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-2}.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 4.27 we show the spectra for two extreme altitudes, sea level and 8000 m above sea level. In Figure 4.28 we show the increase in UV-B, UV-A2, UV-A1 and PAR with ground altitude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.28: Increase in PAR and UV irradiances at ground level under clear sky as a function of ground altitude above sea level. Based on spectral simulations with TUV for sun elevation 45 degrees. UVA-1, violet; UV-A2, purple; UV-B, black.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn reality, the different variables shown individually in the examples in this chapter, can vary in ways that their effects add up, so the total range of variation is larger than is apparent in the examples above.\n\n\n4.1.3.6 Seasons and latitude\nThe main determinant of changes in spectral irradiance with seasons and latitude is the changing path of the sun through the sky, and consequently of the sun elevation angle. However, several other variables play a role. The depth of the ozone column varies with latitude and seasonally. Clouds and the water column depth vary locally and with latitude, as does ground elevation and albedo. The result is that spectral irradiance varies in time and space. One way of summarising this is to describe the local climatology using maps with monthly averages over several years interpolated over a geographic grid. One approach is to use data retrieved by instruments on board satellites. An alternative approach is to describe terrestrial solar radiation at locations where ground-level measurements are available. We start with examples based on this second approach and observations with broadband sensors from ELDONET. From the perspective of research with plants the availability of UV-B, UV-A and PhR data measured concurrently is important.\nConsidering a longer time scale of years, seasonal and daily variation are combined. The seasonal pattern of variation in UV-B daily exposure is very clear but has day to day variation superimposed Figure 4.29. The strong change in the UV-B:PAR photon ratio with sun elevation creates a strong seasonal pattern in this photon ratio Figure 4.29.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.29: Seasonal variation in daily UV-B energy exposure Erlangen, Germany (54^\\circ 10^\\prime \\mathrm{N}, 07^\\circ 51^\\prime \\mathrm{E}, 280 m asl).

Measured with ELDONET instruments (see, Häder et al. 2007).\n\n\n\n\n\nUV-B irradiance increases with elevation in mountains and with decreasing latitude Figure 4.30 and is particularly high on high mountains in equatorial regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.30: Latitudinal variation in annual UV-B and UV-A energy exposure in the Northern Hemisphere. Measured with ELDONET instruments. The ground altitude for these locations varies (see, Häder et al. 2007).\n\n\n\n\n\nI have data for 2-3 years time series measured with the same sensors as the four days plot above. Could be added as they include separate measurements of UV-B, UV-A2, UV-A1, blue, red, far-red and PAR irradiances. Maybe a figure with daily averages per month or week or showing a moving average or moving median could be informative. What do you think?\nMaps for global radiation, UV-B, and UV-A could be added to this section. The daily data are available on-line on a 1/2 degree grid for the last &gt;10 years. Some biologically effective exposures are also available. This is a lot of data. I have already downloaded the last 12 months. Downloading the whole time series with worldwide coverage and computing long-term means would be doable I think, but time consuming. For the time being here are maps for UV-B and UV-A with monthly means of daily doses for the whole world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.31: Monthly means of daily doses of UV-B. Daily data from 2023-10-01 to 2024-09-30 on a 0.5 by 0.5 degrees grid were used to compute monthly means. Grey areas in the map correspond to continuous night or low sun elevation at solar noon, which prevent remote sensing. Under these conditions UV-B irradiance is very low or null.

    "text": "5.1.1 Attenuation of PAR\nThe attenuation of visible and radiation by canopies is difficult to describe mathematically because it is a complex phenomenon. The spatial distribution of leaves is in most cases not uniform, the display angle of the leaves is not random, and may change with depth in the canopy, and even in some cases with time-of-day. We start with one of the simplest approaches to the description of light attenuation with canopy depth: the use of an approximation based on Beer’s law as modified by Monsi and Saeki (1953), reviewed by Hirose (2005). Beer’s law (Equation [eq:Beer-Lambert]) assumes a homogeneous light absorbing medium such as a solution. However, a canopy is heterogenous, with discrete light absorbing objects (the leaves and stems) distributed in a transparent medium (air). I_z = I_0\\cdot\\mathrm{e}^{-K\\,L_z} \\label{eq:Monsi:Saeki} The equation above describes the radiation attenuated as a function of leaf area index (L or ) at a given canopy depth (z). The equation does not explicitly account for the effects of the statistical spatial distribution of leaves and the effects of changing incidence angle of the radiation. Consequently, the empirical attenuation (= extinction) coefficient (K) obtained may vary depending on these factors. K is not only a function of plant species (through leaf optical properties, and how leaves are displayed), but also of time-of-day, and season-of-year—as a consequence of solar zenith angle—and degree of scattering of the incident radiation. As the formula shown here is only a parametrization of Beer’s original equation for homogeneous media, as long as we assume that K does not change with depth in the canopy, it describes an exponential decay as Beer’s law does (Figure 3.7), except that we use leaf area index (LAI) in place of distance (l).\nAs the degree of scattering depends on clouds, sun elevation and on wavelength, the empirical attenuation coefficient (K) is different for UV and VIS radiation, time of day, seasons and state of the vegetation. Radiation attenuation in canopies has yet to be studied in detail with respect to UV radiation, mainly because of difficulties in the measurement of UV radiation compared to VIS radiation, a spectral region that has been extensively studied.\n\n\n5.1.2 Spectrum wihtin vegetation\nUltraviolet radiation is strongly absorbed by plant surfaces, although cuticular waxes and pubescence on leaves can increase UV reflectance. The diffuse fraction of UV radiation in daylight is larger than that of visible light (Figure 4.18). In sunlit patches in forest gaps, the diffuse radiation fraction is smaller than in open areas because direct radiation is not attenuated while part of the sky is occluded by the surrounding forest. Attenuation with canopy depth is on average usually more gradual in tall vegetation like forests than in low vegetation, because of increased size of the area in penumbra.\nThe UV-B irradiance decreases with depth in tree canopies, but the UV-B:PAR ratio tends to increase (see Brown, Parker, and Posner 1994), as it also does when clouds occlude the solar disk (Figure 4.23). In contrast, Deckmyn, Cayenberghs, and Ceulemans (2001) observed a decrease in the UV-B:PAR ratio in white clover canopies with planophyle leaves. Allen, Gausman, and Allen (1975) modelled the penetration in plant canopies, under normal and depleted ozone conditions. Parisi and Wong (1996) measured doses within model plant canopies using dosimeters. The position of leaves affects exposure, and it has been observed that heliotropism can moderate exposure and could be a factor contributing to differences in tolerance among crop cultivars (Grant 1998, 1999a, 1999b, 2004).\nDetailed accounts of different models describing the interaction of radiation and plant canopies, taking into account the properties of foliage, are given by Campbell and Norman (1998) and Monteith and Unsworth (2008).\nMeasurement of spectral irradiance within plant canopies is challenging because of the temporal dynamics and the spatial heterogeneity. One needs to measure all wavelengths within milliseconds and sample in a 3D space. The best tools are array spectrometers, which however, do not natively have a big enough signal to noise ratio to measure UV-B spectral irradiance in the presence of strong visible radiation, as is the case in sunlight and canopy light. Some broadband sensors are visible blind, but they do not resolve spectral irradiance but instead measure the irradiance integrated over a waveband. This technical limitations non-withstanding, progress since the first edition has been very significant in the characterisation of the light environment within different plant canopies.\n\n\n5.1.3 Temporal dynamics and spatial heterogeneity\n\n\n5.1.4 Spectral irradiance at the plant surface\nRay tracing models, etc.\n\n\n5.1.5 Radiation within leaves\nThe same analysis as done for optical filters in section XXX with only two parallel air-glass interfaces, can in principle, be applied to an object with a heterogeneous internal structure, like a plant leaf with its multiple internal air-water interfaces. However, one would need to consider these multiple internal interfaces and their positions. The presence of these interfaces at different angles, plus small particles, cause strong scattering, and thus in this case \\rho depends on both surface and internal properties of the leaf. We can still measure \\rho, \\tau and \\alpha but predicting them based on optical theory becomes daunting if at all possible. Simulation models based on a simplified description of leaves’ structure and pigments, such as PROSPECT can provide good approximations.\nOne way of demonstrating and/or measuring the role of air-water interfaces within leaf tissues on its optical properties is to infiltrate a leaf with water using a vacuum chamber so as to fill with water all air spaces within the leaf. The effect is most spectacular in a variegated leaf such as those from some clones of English ivy: after infiltration with water the green areas become translucent green and the white areas almost transparent. Obviously, the ability to greatly increase the number of photons absorbed with the same number of pigment molecules can greatly increase the efficiency of photosynthesis as well as the ability of photoreceptors to sense very low irradiances.\nThe internal structure of leaves has evolved to be extremely efficient at trapping light, to the point that it has been copied in a recent design for high efficiency solar cells (Yun et al. 2019). There is also evidence that shade leaves are better light traps per unit dry mass than sun leaves. On the other hand, modelling of the optical properties of leaves is still in its infancy. The optics of leaves, flowers and fruits are described in detail in the book (D. Lee 2007).",

    "text": "5.2 Radiation in aquatic plants’ environment\nAs solar radiation passes through a body of water, its spectrum changes with depth in a wavelength-dependent manner, determined by the optical characteristics of that water body. The penetration of UV radiation through water bodies can vary from only few centimetres in highly humic lakes (Kirk 1994a, 1994b; P. S. Huovinen, Penttilä, and Soimasuo 2003) to dozens of metres in the oceans (Smith et al. 1992; Kirk 1994a, 1994b). Some irradiance is reflected at the water surface, but the extent to which wavelengths in the UV to IR range penetrate water bodies depends mainly on (1) attenuation by water itself, (2) coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and seston. Seston is the sum of living organic material (mainly phytoplankton) and non-living material (tripton). Non-living particles are further distinguished between organic material (detritus) and inorganic suspended matter. Each fraction has its own characteristic spectral absorption and scattering properties (reviewed by Dekker 1993; Kirk 1994a, 1994b; Hargreaves 2003; Wozniak and Dera 2007).\nParticularly in coastal areas and shallow areas of lakes and streams, irradiance reflected from the ground or sea-bed beneath the water (henceforth bottom) influences the profile of radiation through the aquatic environment. This reflectance is described by a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), which is wavelength specific and depends on the incident and reflected angle. If the reflectance is equally distributed in all directions, the bottom is a so called Lambertian reflector and the BRDF is constant. The bottom reflectance is greatly influenced by its slope and properties, i.e. whether the bottom is bare sediment or covered by algae and submersed vegetation (e.g. Maritorena, Morel, and Gentili 1994; Albert and Mobley 2003; Mobley and Sundman 2003; Mobley, Zhang, and Voss 2003; Pinnel 2007).\n\n5.2.1 Refraction\nThe refraction of incoming (downwelling) radiance at the water surface can be determined by Snell’s law, which describes the angular refraction of the incident beam. The radiation passes the first medium with a refractive index n_1 and then the second medium with a refractive index n_2. If the incoming direction of the radiation is given by the angle \\theta_1, the beam is refracted to the angle \\theta_2. Snell’s law is n_1 \\cdot \\sin\\theta_1 = n_2 \\cdot \\sin\\theta_2 For the case of radiation arriving from the air under the incident angle \\theta_i and going into the water with the transmitted angle \\theta_t, this yields a refractive index for the air of n_a=1 and for the water of n_W=1.33 \\theta_t = \\arcsin \\left( 0.75\\cdot \\sin\\theta_i \\right)\nTheoretically, n_W is not constant but depends on temperature, wavelength and salinity, as described by Quan and Fry (1995). In principle, the shorter the wavelength, the higher the refractive index of water, but in practice the wavelength-dependent difference in refraction is unimportant. For example comparing the values at 400 and 800 nm for 20and no salinity produces a difference of &lt; 0.5%. If the wind speed is high, the slope of surface waves also has to be taken into account. A rough surface reflects and transmits the incoming radiation beam in more directions and makes the radiation field more diffuse than a smooth surface.\n\n\n5.2.2 Absorption and scattering by pure water\nWater itself absorbs and scatters radiation. The optical properties of the water in the visible and ultraviolet (UV) spectrum are not precisely known, since no theoretical model exists which exactly describes the absorption and scattering properties of pure water. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on laboratory measurements to approximate the values of these parameters. Investigations into absorption by water a_W were initially documented by Morel (1974), Smith and Tyler (1976), Smith and Baker (1981), Pegau and Zaneveld (1993) and more recently by Buiteveld, Hakvoort, and Donze (1994) and Hakvoort (1994). The absorption properties of water also depend on temperature. The influence of temperature is weak below 700 nm, but its effect increases with increasing wavelength; so, for example, a temperature increase of 10 K produces a \\approx7% change in the absolute value of a_W at 740 nm.\nThe scattering of radiation by molecules in liquids has been modelled theoretically by Smoluchowski (1908) and Einstein (1910). This approach is based on statistical thermodynamics and is called the theory of fluctuation. Theoretically, the scattering function is wavelength-dependent and follows the \\lambda^{-4} law. Experiments show a slight deviation from the model, giving a better correlation with \\lambda^{-4.32} (Morel 1974) due to the effects of isothermal compressibility, the refractive index of water, and the pressure derivative of the refractive index of water (Hakvoort 1994).\nThe wavelength dependency of the absorption and scattering coefficients of pure water are shown in Figure [fig:Water:Abs_Scat] using data from Hakvoort (1994). Water mainly contributes to the attenuation of PAR and IR wavelengths, since absorption by pure water increases from around 550 nm towards longer wavelengths.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Absorption and scattering by water constituents\nAbsorption and scattering by water constituents is the sum of (1) absorption by CDOM, sometimes also called yellow or humic substances, gilvin or gelbstoff, (2) absorption and scattering by living material like phytoplankton, and (3) absorption and scattering by dead organic and inorganic particles. The influence of each constituent on the scattering process depends on wavelength, particle size, concentration, and refractive index. Theoretical details are explained in, for example, Hulst (1981).\nCDOM mainly refers to coloured dissolved humic materials and consists of humic and fulvic acids, originating from decomposed plant material suspended in the water or entering from the surrounding catchment area. The pigments in humic and fulvic acids absorb strongly in the blue and UV wavelengths and are dissolved and therefore do not scatter irradiance. Kalle (1966) recognised that CDOM absorption decreases exponentially with increasing wavelength in the visible part of the spectra. Following the study of Morel and Prieur (1976), Bricaud, Morel, and Prieur (1981) expressed this relationship in the following model: for a known absorption at a wavelength \\lambda_0=440 nm, the CDOM absorption a_Y can be determined by a_Y(\\lambda) = a_Y(\\lambda_0)\\cdot {\\rm e}^{-s_Y(\\lambda-\\lambda_0)} \\label{equ_ay} Although the exponential coefficient s_Y is variable, a standard value of s_Y=0.014 nm^{-1} is commonly used. Bricaud, Morel, and Prieur (1981) compared the value of s_Y across many data sets and reported a standard deviation of only \\Delta s_Y=\\pm 0.003 nm^{-1}. The amount of CDOM in water is determined by filtration using membrane filters of 0.2 \\mum pore size. The filtrate is collected into a quartz cuvette with length l and put into a (double beam) spectrophotometer to measure its absorbance (optical density) A(\\lambda). Then, a_Y(\\lambda)=2.303\\cdot\\frac{A(\\lambda)}{l} (Kirk 1994a). The absorption coefficient at 440 nm has been used as an indication of optical colour (Kirk 1994a), while size of humic molecules has been estimated from the ratio \\frac{a_Y(\\lambda=250{\\rm nm})}{a_Y(\\lambda={\\rm 365 nm})}, with increasing size indicated by smaller ratios (Haan 1972, 1993; Haan, Boer, and T 1987). To determine a_Y from clearer (e.g. oceanic) waters, a cuvette with a 10 cm path-length is generally needed due to their low values of absorption.\nPhytoplankton can contribute to the attenuation of PAR through absorption by their photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll and pheophytin, but they can also cause scattering. The absorption by phytoplankton a_P is the sum of absorption by each pigment multiplied each by their concentrations. Due to the fact that many species of phytoplankton occur in aquatic environments and every species contains more than one pigment, it is more practicable to calculate the absorption by mean specific absorption coefficients for each different algal species separately. This has been done by Gege (1998) for freshwater Lake Constance in Germany and by Prieur and Sathyendranath (1981) for an oceanic environment. Besides these examples, there are other models for oceanic waters that use the specific in vivo absorption coefficient and concentration of chlorophyll-a, a_{chl}^* and C_{chl}, respectively. Morel (1991) found that the power law a_P = 0.06\\, a_{chl}^*\\, [C_{chl}]^{0.65}, which was first proposed by Prieur and Sathyendranath (1981), provided the best estimate of the absorption coefficient for his data set. C_{chl} is the concentration of chlorophyll-a in units of \\mug l^{-1}. Figure [fig:Phyto:Abs] shows the specific oceanic chlorophyll absorption coefficient from Morel (1991) normalized to maximum absorption at 440 nm. Figure [fig:Phyto:Abs] also shows laboratory measurements of chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-b absorption1 after Frigaard, Larsen, and Cox (1996). Spectra for chlorophyll absorption, and that of various other photochemically-relevant substances, are also available in computer software such as PhotochemCAD2 (Du et al. 1998; Dixon, Taniguchi, and Lindsey 2005). The empirical model of Bricaud et al. (1995) parameterises the specific absorption coefficient from C_{chl}. This model draws on extensive studies of more than 800 spectra to give a_P^*(\\lambda) = A(\\lambda)[C_{chl}]^{-B(\\lambda)} with positive empirical coefficients A and B depending on wavelength. The model incorporates both the package effect of phytoplankton cells and the effect of the varying pigment composition on absorption.\nThe particulate structure of phytoplankton cells causes scattering. The influence of phytoplankton on the total scattering coefficient depends on the other constituents of the water body. For water containing a low concentration of inorganic suspended sediment scattering is driven by the concentration of phytoplankton (as occurs in the open ocean). Gordon and Morel (1983) developed an empirical model, which directly correlates scattering with the pigment concentration of chlorophyll-a C_{chl} in units of \\mug l^{-1}. The scattering coefficient of phytoplankton b_P in units of m^{-1} is given by b_P(\\lambda) = B \\cdot [C_{chl}]^{0.62} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_0}{\\lambda}\\right) \\label{equ_bp_emp} with \\lambda_0=550 nm and B=0.3 as mean values for oceanic waters dominated by phytoplankton. The equation ([equ_bp_emp]) is valid for a range of phytoplankton concentrations from 0.05 to 1 \\mug l^{-1}. Gordon and Morel (1983) found that oceanic waters have a value of B\\le 0.45. Higher values are used for other aquatic environments, for example turbid coastal waters. In coastal regions, Sathyendranath, Prieur, and Morel (1989) proposed that the scattering coefficient is indirectly proportional to absorption by phytoplankton: b_P(\\lambda) \\propto 1/a_P(\\lambda). The proportionality factor depends on the concentration of chlorophyll-a in the same manner as the scattering coefficient of equation ([equ_bp_emp]). Dekker (1993) investigated the contribution to scattering of each water constituent in inland waters3. He found that the composition of scattering particles was more variable in inland waters than in the ocean and it depended on the trophic state of the water and therefore on the distribution of organic and inorganic particulate matter. The scattering and backscattering coefficient of phytoplankton can be determined by b_P(\\lambda)=b_P^*(\\lambda) \\cdot C_P where the specific scattering coefficient of phytoplankton is b_P^*. For lakes Dekker (1993) reported that the specific scattering coefficient of phytoplankton ranges from 0.12 to 0.18 m^2mg^{-1} at a wavelength of 550 nm. The specific scattering coefficients can be obtained by integrating the scattering phase function of the observed matter, here, phytoplankton. Extensive and commonly used measurements were done by Petzold (1977). Other functions can be found for example in Mobley (1994).\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nParticulate matter in water bodies consists of organic and inorganic material. The organic constituents are contained in phytoplankton cells or are fragments of dead plankton and faecal pellets of zooplankton. These parts are often called detritus. Inorganic particles include suspended mineral coming from inflows or resuspension at coastal regions. They mainly consist of quartz, clay, and calcite. There are only a few published values of the specific absorption coefficients of suspended particles in water from aquatic environments because they are difficult to separate into their individual constituent parts. A comparison of these values is given by Pozdnyakov and Grassl (2003). In general, absorption by all suspended particles in most water bodies is very low and it is negligible for inorganic particles. Roesler, Perry, and Carder (1989) produced the following relationship for absorption by detritus in coastal waters which is very similar that of CDOM: a_X(\\lambda) = a_X(\\lambda_0) \\cdot {\\rm e}^{-s_X(\\lambda-\\lambda_0)} \\label{equ_adet} with a mean value of s_X=0.011 nm^{-1} and a_X(\\lambda_0)=0.09 m^{-1} at \\lambda_0=400 nm for their data. Particulate matter in general causes more scattering of irradiance than it absorbs. In coastal waters and freshwater, scattering is higher than in oceanic waters due to the additional presence of particles not related to phytoplankton. These particles come from suspended inorganic sediments of different sizes. Scattering is caused by differences in the refractive indices of the two materials (the water medium and the material of the particles) and are due to the ratio of particle size to wavelength. Different functions of scattering coefficients and phase functions are, for example, described by Mobley (1994). Especially turbid and coastal waters, or rivers and lakes, are dominated by large particles (&gt;1 \\mum and a refraction index of 1.03). Therefore, the scattering coefficient of non-living particles b_X can be estimated while neglecting their size distribution and wavelength dependence. Thus, b_X is derived from b_X(\\lambda) = b_X^* \\cdot C_X, with the concentration of the total suspended matter C_X and the specific scattering coefficients b_X^*. Dekker (1993) gave example specific scattering coefficients of 0.23 to 0.79 m^2 g^{-1} for different trophic states in lakes.\n\n\n5.2.4 Results and effects\nIn summary, after considering all the components that absorb radiation, in very clear non-productive oceanic waters blue-green wavelengths in the PAR spectrum dominate, whereas in highly-coloured, humic inland waters blue wavelengths are rapidly attenuated. In humic lakes, CDOM largely governs UV attenuation (e.g. Kirk 1994a, 1994b; Scully and Lean 1994; P. S. Huovinen, Penttilä, and Soimasuo 2003)), whereas in oceans (Smith and Baker 1979) and clear lakes containing low CDOM concentrations the contribution of phytoplankton to UV attenuation can be significant (Sommaruga and Psenner 1997). If very turbid water contains a large amount of inorganic particles, CDOM is bonded by calcium carbonate contained in the particles, and consequently the colour of the water returns to blue.\nThere is marked variation in the penetration of UV radiation among water bodies, and within a water body during the year. Global changes, such as climate warming and acidification (Schindler et al. 1996; Yan et al. 1996; Donahue et al. 1998) can lead to increased underwater UV penetration, likewise UV-B radiation itself which can positively affect its own penetration through the photodegradation of CDOM (Morris and Hargreaves 1997). Variation in the absorption properties of dissolved organic compounds with the seasons and according to their origin and molecular weight (Stewart and Wetzel 1980; Hessen and Tranvik 1998; Lean 1998), interferes with our estimation of UV penetration based on CDOM concentrations. Temporal changes in the absorption characteristics of CDOM have also been reported, with fresh CDOM being photochemically more active than older CDOM (Lean 1998). It is also notable that UV radiation has been shown to penetrate deeper in saline prairie lakes than in fresh waters of corresponding CDOM concentrations (Arts et al. 2000).\nEstimations of CDOM are relatively easy to perform and therefore often used for in situ and remote sensing measurements of optical properties. However, another parameter called dissolved organic carbon (DOC, in units of mg l^{-1}) is also useful to measure, since it is more interpretable for studies of carbon cycling and in the context of global change research. Kowalczuk et al. (2010), report that CDOM contributes approximately 20% to the total DOC pool in the open ocean and up to 70% in coastal areas. Unfortunately, on a global scale it has not yet been possible to make a direct link between CDOM and DOC due to the heterogeneous organic composition of CDOM. Until that connection is made, estimation of the universal bulk carbon-specific CDOM absorption coefficient, defined as the ratio of CDOM absorption to DOC concentration, remains almost impossible (Wozniak and Dera 2007), but at least there are good correlations between a_Y and DOC concentrations in coastal areas (Kowalczuk et al. 2010).\nAquatic organisms can be affected not only directly but also indirectly through UV-dependent changes in the surrounding water, e.g. through increased formation of photochemical reaction products such as singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. Especially in lakes with low DOC concentrations, photoenhanced toxicity of some environmental contaminants or release of complexed metals into the water can occur due to the photodegradation of organic matter (Zepp 1982; Palenik, Price, and Morel 1991; Hessen and Donk 1994; Arfsten, Schaeffer, and Mulveny 1996; Scully et al. 1997). Despite the potential for detrimental effects, the final impact of UV radiation on organisms may be mitigated by their protective and repair mechanisms (Karentz, Cleaver, and Mitchell 1991; Mitchell and Karentz 1993; Vincent and Roy 1993), which somehow also depend on certain wavelengths of irradiation. When evaluating the exposure of seaweeds to UV radiation, it should be taken into account that other factors, such as kelp canopies, can markedly reduce the PAR and UV radiation reaching their understorey. Furthermore, the underwater radiation received by seaweeds can be significantly altered depending on the tidal range (P. Huovinen and Gómez 2011). Phenolic compounds released from large brown algae into the surrounding water can also locally attenuate UV radiation.\nClassifications of water bodies based on their optical characteristics have been developed as general tools in order to allow comparisons between different water bodies. Jerlov (1976) traditional and widely-used classification of marine waters, based on their transmittance of irradiance at different wavelengths, recognizes three oceanic (I–III) and nine coastal (1–9) types of water body (Figure [fig:Jerlov]). Morel and Prieur (1977) classified ocean waters into two types based on their optically dominant components: (i) phytoplankton and their products dominate case-i waters, (ii) particles and dissolved coloured material dominate case-ii waters. The classification proposed by Kirk (1980) is principally suited to inland waters and is based on the spectral absorption of the soluble and particulate fractions. Kirk (1980) defined type G waters, in which CDOM is the dominant light-absorbing component, compared with type T, W and A waters, where tripton, water itself and phytoplankton dominate respectively. Beyond these scales, various other optical classifications have also been proposed (reviewed by Kirk 1994a; Hargreaves 2003).\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n5.2.5 Modelling of underwater radiation\nFollowing Beer’s law (Equation [eq:Beer-Lambert]), for deep water (no reflection from bottom), radiance L(\\lambda) decreases exponentially with depth z in the water column: L(z,\\lambda) = L(z=0,\\lambda)\\cdot\\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{a\\cdot z}{\\cos\\theta}} \\label{equ_beer} alternatively written as \\cos\\theta\\,\\frac{{\\rm d}L(z,\\lambda)}{{\\rm d}z} = -a\\cdot L(z,\\lambda) \\label{equ_dbeer} \\theta is the zenith angle of the incoming (downwelling) radiance in water. Note that Eqs. [equ_beer] and [equ_dbeer] are only valid if the water column is homogeneous with depth and there are no scattering particles and internal sources of light in the water, i.e. no fluorescence, raman scattering, nor bioluminescence. Thus, calculation of actual radiative transfer in water (not under idealised conditions) is much more complicated and can only be solved approximately by using empirical, semi-analytical or computational models (Dekker 1993; Mobley 1994; Z. P. Lee, Carder, and Arnone 2002; Albert and Gege 2006).\nThe radiative transfer equations [equ_beer] and [equ_dbeer] are valid for radiance L, which represents the collimated beam from one specific direction. Due to their construction, radiance detectors do not measure a beam from an infinitely small solid angle, they have an aperture of typically one or two degrees. Other types of detectors sense light from more than one direction, they measure the entire sphere or hemisphere (for details see also section [sec:basic:concepts] on page ), by integrating the incoming radiance over all directions. Another useful relationship between irradiance and fluence rate can be obtained using the Gershun equation: \\frac{\\rm d}{{\\rm d}z} E(z,\\lambda) = -a \\, E_0(z,\\lambda) \\label{equ_gershun} If, for example, only the downwelling irradiance E_d(z,\\lambda) is measured or necessary for calculating radiative transfer, Equation [equ_dbeer] yields \\frac{{\\rm d}E_d(z,\\lambda)}{{\\rm d}z} = -K_d\\cdot E_d(z,\\lambda) \\label{equ_downirr} giving the diffuse attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance, K_d. K_d is related to the total absorption a and scattering b as well as to \\theta and also the solar zenith angle \\theta_s (Kirk 1991; Albert and Mobley 2003). A practical and often-used method to estimate K_d, and therefore the transparency of the water, is the Secchi disk test. The visibility of a submerged white disk can be correlated to downwelling diffuse attenuation (Tyler 1968). This and also the penetration depth z_d give useful information about the water body. The penetration of irradiance important for photosynthesis (primary production) is often expressed as the depth at which, for example, 1% or 10% of the value just below the water surface is reached. The depth, where 1% of PAR is reached, separates the euphotic zone from the aphotic zone. After Kirk (1994a), z_d can be obtained from K_d: z_d(1\\%) = 4.6/K_d and z_d(10\\%) = 2.3/K_d. In Figure [fig:Valdivia], an example of spectral attenuation of solar radiation at different depths, as well as the penetration depths of UV-B, UV-A radiation and PAR are given for coastal waters of the south-eastern Pacific Ocean (off the coast of Chile).\nA very useful tool to simulate spectral radiance and irradiance under water, depending on different concentrations of the water constituents or bottom depth and type, is called WASI (water colour simulator, (Gege 2004)). The software includes different analytical parameterisations and it can also be used for inverse calculations, i.e. for estimating optical properties and concentrations of water constituents from (remote sensing) measurements. The software program including the manual is available free of charge using an anonymous login at the ftp server ftp://ftp.dfd.dlr.de/pub/WASI. Other models, which include angular distributions of radiation under water are, for example, the Monte Carlo method (Prahl et al. 1989; Wang, Jacques, and Zheng 1995)4, HydroLight (technique described by (Mobley 1994)), or EcoLight-S (Mobley 2011).\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbert, A., and P.

    "text": "6.1 Introduction to radiation measurement\nIn this chapter guidance is given on how to measure and how to interpret quantities describing the properties radiation, including the application of the concepts of radiation physics presented in Chapter 2 to the description and quantification of radiation in ways relevant to experimentation in plant photobiology and the management of crops.\nIn research, When describing experimental conditions it is necessary to avoid all ambiguity, so that current results can be interpreted correctly and experiments reproduced. Expressions such as “light intensity” and “amount of light”, which are ambiguous, must be avoided. In addition, ambiguity must be also avoided in equipment specifications and management recommendations targeted at growers and other stakeholders. They depend on the information provided as a basis for decisions affecting the success of their activities or even the succesful implementation of government policies.\nInstruments used to measure the properties of radiation are imperfect. All measurements are subject to errors and uncontrolled variation. Some of this variation is inherent to the individual instrument, including bias. However, variation also occurs in response to other variables in the environment such as temperature and humidity. In addition, the radiation-detectors used in some sensors as well as electronic components used in the circuits that amplify and record the measured quantities, age, i.e., their properties change with time. Thus,to ensure accuracy and reproducibility, recalibration of instruments at regular intervals is a must.\nHow the instruments are used, i.e., consistently following a correct measurement protocol together with good awareness of the limitations of the equipment are unavoidable requirements for accurate and reproducible measurements of all properties of radiation.\nA comprehensive glossary of terms relating to visible and ultraviolet radiation has been published by Braslavsky (2007). It can be downloaded from the Internet (see link in reference list).\nAfter an introduction to the different types of instruments and discussing generic features of measurement protocols including some caveats, the remaining of this chapter is organized by physical and biologically relevant quantities, starting from those covering the widest range of wavelengths. For each quantity commonly used sensors and instruments are described together with specific measurement protocols and common errors and pitfalls affecting them. Suppliers known to the authors are also listed.",

    "text": "Accuracy and precision of radiation measurements\n\n\n\nIt is important to consider in each situation what are the required accuracy and precision. When estimating changes in irradiance over long periods of time, instrument calibration drift is the most important source of bias. When comparing measurements done with different instruments, the accuracy of their calibrations and possible bias introduced by extraneous variables such as temperature are most important. These are the hurdles that meteorologists most frequently have to deal with.\nIn a biological experiment were the different light conditions are measured with the same broadband sensor, the main consideration is whether the calibration of the instrument is valid under each light condition. When measuring a light source at near range (up to several meters), using the correct distance between source and sensor becomes crucial. When small differences among conditions are more important that absolute values, precision is more important than accuracy.\nExtraneous shading and reflections by objects and by the operator during measurements can introduce very large errors haphazardly. Poor levelling of diffusers, and in permanent installations, soiling of diffusers can also become important sources of bias.\nReplication in time and space are needed to quantify real-world variation. On the other hand, the accuracy of calibrations is reported in calibration certificates. This accuracy applies only to the calibration itself under the conditions under which it was done, and weakens with differences in temperature and with time. Sensor specifications sometimes include a description of the dependency on temperature and in most cases recommended annual or bi-annual recalibration.\nIt is also important to keep in mind that many instruments reach rated accuracy only after a warming-up period. This applies also to artificial light sources, including LEDs. They should be measured only after their temperature is stable and obviously at the same temperature as when used.\nIt is worrying that in biological research these points are rarely taken into full consideration, and almost never described in the methods section of publications.",

    "section": "6.2 Spectroradiometers",
    "text": "6.2 Spectroradiometers\nSpectroradiometers measure spectral irradiance, usually expressed in \\mathrm{W\\,m^2\\,nm^{-1}} or equivalent units differing only by a scaling factor, e.g., \\mathrm{mW\\,cm^2\\,nm^{-1}}. The wavelength resolution of spectrometers can vary from a fraction of a nanometre to a few tens of nanometres. What distinguishes data obtained with a spectroradiometer is that radiation over a wide range of wavelengths is quantified at each of many (\\gg\n100) contiguous narrow wavelength “slices” or bands. Spectroradiometers are spectrometers with entrance optics that makes it possible to measure irradiance or, exceptionaly, fluence rate.\nSpectrometers fall into two main groups: array spectrometers based on an array of detectors and a single static monochromator grating, and scanning spectrometers based on a single detector and one or two moving monochromators. Within each approach there are different types of detectors in use, different types of monochromators, and different optics. However, in some respects array and scanning spectrometers are fundamentally different.\nIn array spectrometers the monochromator projects radiation of different wavelengths onto different sensors arranged as a linear (1-dimentional) array. Thus, the whole spectrum is measured simultaneously. In a scanning spectrometer, the moving grating projects the radiation of different wavelengths sequentially onto the same and only sensor. Thus, radiation at each wavelength “slice” is measured at a different point in time.\nScanning spectroradiometers a based on a mechanism that accurately moves the manochromator(s) in very small steps, in most cases motorised. Mechanical accuracy and sturdiness depend a rigid, and heavy structure. For this reason, scanning spectrometers are in general much bigger and heavier, and, thus, more difficult to transport than array detector spectroradiometers. They are also less tolerant to rough handling and usually require mains power. However, scanning spectrometers can accomodate a double monochromator arrangement. The two monochromators are “in series” such that the light beam passes through both of them before reaching the sensor. This improves markedly the separation of light of different wavelengths reaching the sensor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe term spectrometer is used to indicate that the same instrument, depending on its attachments and calibration, can be also used to measure spectral absorbance, -transmittance, or -reflectance, in addition to spectral irradiance.\n\n\n\n6.2.1 Scanning spectroradiometers\nTHIS SECTION FOCUSES MAINLY ON THE SPECTRORADIOMETERS USED FOR LONG TIME SERIES OF UV MEASUREMENTS IN METEOROLOGY. IT ONLY MENTIONS IN PASSING SCANNING SPECTRORADIOMETERS FREQUENTLY USED BY BIOLOGISTS. THIS SECTION NEEDS SOME EXPANSION AND REORGANIZATION. MENTION OR MANUAL INSTRUMENTS NOW NO LONGER USED, COULD HOWEVER, WORK AS AN INTRODUCTION AS THEY ARE SIMPLER WHILE BASED ON THE SAME PRINCIPLES. e.g. LI-COR LI-1800 from 1980’s and ISCO SR from 1970’s.\n\n6.2.1.1 Basic structure and principles of operation\nThe basic components of a scanning spectroradiometer designed for fixed installation outdoors are: a) input optics for collecting radiation from the sky and guiding it further into the spectroradiometer b) a monochromator for resolving the input radiation into separate wavelengths c) a photomultiplier tube (PMT) or a solid state detector for sequentially quantifying the energy in each spectral component of the measured radiation. In addition, scanning spectroradiometers in most cases need to be used tethered to a personal computer or tablet as they usually lack a built-in screen for user interface or enough memory for data storage. EXAMPLE SPECTRORADIOMETER is needed here!! Biospherical and Brewer.\nThe input optics typically consist of a flat PTFE (“Teflon”) diffuser disk covered by a quartz dome. The diffuser collects the incident photons from the overhead hemisphere. The resulting diffuse radiation is guided to the entrance slit of the monochromator, sometimes by means of an optical fibre. The monochromator may be a single or a double monochromator (see section spectrographs). In scanning spectroradiometers, a system based on a step motor drives a mask that allows only photons of a certain wavelength at a time to enter the exit slit of the monochromator. The exit slit serves as the entrance window to the cathode of the PMT. The photon pulses are amplified and transmitted to a photon counter for registration.\nWhile most frequently irradiance is measured on a plane parallel to the ground, to measure “normal solar irradiance” spectroradiometers can be mounted on a solar tracker that follows the position of the sun maintaining the plane of the diffuser facing directly into the sun. A measurement head at the end of an optical fibre may be also installed on a separate sun tracker. The temperature of the instrument is usually either stabilized or kept above a certain temperature limit to ensure proper functioning. The dome of the measurement head may be equipped with a heater and/or air blower to keep the temperature of the teflon within certain limits and to avoid formation of frost or dew on the dome surface.\nScanning spectroradiometers intended for laboratory or spot measurements outdoors are smaller and less rugged. They are more portable but more sensitive to temperature extremes and are not water proof. Examples of such instruments are Optronics OL 756 and Macam SR9910 spectroradiometers. Figure [fig:Optronics:OL_756] shows the different parts of the first of these instruments.\n\n\n\n\nThe more rugged instruments, usually permanently installed at a fixed location, are commonly used for measuring long (several years long) time series of spectral irradiance data. The more portable instruments are used for spot measurements in plant canopies, and under lamps, and or filters. The first type of instrument is most commonly used by meteorologists, while the portable instruments are most useful to biologists.\n\n\n6.2.1.2 Characteristics\nDark current and dead time are characteristics possessed by the PMT. Dark current is a measure of the drift photons going from the cathode to the anode of the PMT without any real incident photons entering the instrument. Dead time is a measure of that PMT which is in a paralysed state after a photon detection event. Stray light is composed of photons reflected from wavelengths other than the nominal wavelength being measured. In commercially available scanning spectroradiometers, these phenomena are usually measured and handled by the measurement software.\nThe wavelength alignment of a spectroradiometer has to be checked regularly. Most instruments taking continuously sequential measurements contain an internal mercury lamp aimed at ensuring the stability of the alignment. The wavelength and the position of the micrometer turning the grating of the monochromator are related to each other by a second-order equation using so called dispersion coefficients. The determination of the dispersion coefficients should be part of the annual maintenance of the instruments.\nSolar irradiance spectra sometimes exhibit so called noise spikes, which mean sudden abnormally high or low intensity readings on a single wavelength. The origin of the spikes is not fully known, but straylight is considered a partial explanation. The spikes can be detected and eliminated making use of suitable reference spectra.\nIdeally, the angular response of the measurement head follows the shape of a cosine curve. In practice, the response deviates somewhat from this. Typically, the larger the solar zenith angle, the larger the deviation. The cosine response of the measurement head should be measured in laboratory and a corresponding correction applied to measured data.\nIf the spectroradiometer is not stabilized for temperature, its response usually exhibits temperature dependence. This dependence should be determined in the laboratory by measuring a calibration lamp with a spectroradiometer heated/cooled over a range of different wavelengths. The measurements can be used for deriving the temperature correction factors to be applied in the post-processing of the sky measurements.\nThe slit function determines the transmittance of a monochromator as a function wavelength. The ideal shape of the function would be triangular. The full width at half maximum of the slit function is commonly used as a quantity characterizing the slit function. The slit function can be derived by measuring the irradiance emitted by a tunable laser. Removal of the effect of the slit function on the measured spectra should be considered if spectra measured by two or several instruments are to be compared with each other.\nThe spectral responsivity of a spectroradiometer should be based on regular measurements of a certified calibration lamp. If the responsivity seems to have changed, basically two alternative ways to handle the change exist. The change may be introduced in the responsivity of the instrument and the processing of the sky measurements as such. A step-wise change in response is hence introduced in the time series of the measurements. Alternatively, a gradually changing response time-series may be defined using a moving average with a suitable time window. In this way, the change in the response is introduced gradually in the time series of the sky irradiance measurements.\n\n\n6.2.1.3 Maintenance\nThe maintenance of a scanning spectroradiometer operating in an outdoor environment involves the following practices: a) general daily maintenance; b) checks on the wavelength setting and stability of irradiance scale; c) calibration of irradiance against primary standards in a dark room.\nDaily routine maintenance includes cleaning of the quartz dome and checking on the general functioning as well as the correct levelling of the instrument. The quartz dome should also be cleaned/dried after rain or snow. The operator should be familiar with the control software of the instrument. Additional simple routines based on, for instance, selected reference spectra may be used for instant checking of the measured data. These kinds of routines are invaluable in the prompt detection of occasional malfunctions of the instrument.\nAn internal Hg lamp is used for checking of the wavelength scale in some spectroradiometers. In these cases, it is convenient to imbed the Hg lamp measurement into the daily measurement schedule. If the instrument lacks an internal lamp, this check has to be done using an external lamp. For checking the stability of the irradiance scale, portable calibration units are available. These enable, for instance, stability checks of the instrument at the measuring site on a weekly basis. It is advisable that the humidity indicators are also checked on a weekly basis.\nIrradiance calibration of a spectroradiometer should be performed in a dark room (Figure [fig:Brewer:calibration]). A primary standard lamp with an irradiance certificate provided by a certified laboratory of standards is needed. To extend the lifetime of the primary standard lamp, it is recommended that it is not used as a regular calibration lamp. Instead, the irradiance scale of the primary lamp should be transferred to a secondary standard lamp that is used as a working calibration lamp. Use of several working lamps is recommended to enable recognition of potential drifts in the radiant output of the lamps as they age. Calibration against the primary/secondary standard lamp should be performed at least every two months. The desiccant bags inside the cover of the spectrometer should be taken out and dried at least every two months as well. Proper levelling of the instrument has to be ensured after having it relocated for outdoor measurements.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nOn the annual maintenance practices of a spectroradiometer, each manufacturer has its own services and recommendations. Participation in intercomparison campaigns gathering a number of state-of-the-art instruments to conduct measurements on a jointly agreed schedule for a period of time has proven a fruitful way to investigate the long-term stabilities and overall performances of scanning spectroradiometers (Figure [fig:Brewer:intercomparison]).\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Array detector spectroradiometers\nIn contrast to scanning spectrometers, array detector instruments measure spectral irradiance simultaneously at all wavelengths. The detector in this case is a linear array of light sensors, similar in structure to the imaging sensors used in digital cameras, but long and narrow. The number of detector elements (‘pixels’) along the array varies, 2000 to 3000 pixels being common for visible light and fewer in IR-only spectrometers. The array can be a ‘charge coupled device’ (CCD), or an array of photodiodes (DAD). The ‘image’ of the spectrum produced by the monochromator is projected and focused by means of mirrors onto the linear detector array, each detector in the array receiving light of a certain very narrow range of wavelengths. In the case of array spectrometers it is not possible to use two monochromators in tandem to reduce stray light. Array spectrometers are small and portable (Figure [fig:Maya2000Pro]).\n \nFor measuring energy or photon spectral irradiance a cosine diffuser is used as input optics. This ensures that the angular response follows the cosine law, and so the instrument measures the radiation as received on a flat surface. Other input optics are also available, for example, with a narrow angle of view. However, the quantity measured with them is not irradiance. Cosine diffusers differ widely in how closely they follow the cosine law. Some cheaper models are prone to large errors, especially when radiation impinges at a sharp angle to their surface. This will be further discussed in section 9.7.2.1 on page .\nThe input optics is usually connected to the array spectrometer with an optical fibre. The type of fibre to be used depends on the wavelength range to be measured. If smaller than the entrance of the spectroradiometer, the diameter of the fibre will affect the amount of radiation entering the instrument. The diameter also affects the mechanical properties of the fibre: thin fibres are more flexible and tolerate bending into curves of smaller diameter. Fibres also vary with regards to the type of cladding material used to protect them. Fibres with metal cladding tolerate rougher handling than those with plastic cladding. The most common connector for these fibres and accessories is the SMA 905, originally designed for light fibres used in digital communication systems. For this reason their positioning upon repeated attachment is not exactly the same. Consequently, the recommendation is not to detach and reattach the fibre from the spectrometer without recalibrating the system[^24].\nAt the entrance of the spectrometer, just behind the connector to which the fibre is attached, there is a slit (Figure [fig:CCD:slit]), which limits the width and height of the incoming light beam. The width is of the order of a few micrometres and the exact value chosen determines, together with the monochromator, the spectral resolution of the spectroradiometer. The narrower the slit, the narrower the beam hitting the monochromator and the better the resolution (the narrower the peaks that can be resolved). In a Czerny-Turner configuration (Figure [fig:optical:bench]), the next component is a collimating mirror which projects the beam onto a monochromator. Gratings are used as monochromators. Gratings have a surface with very closely spaced rulings of a specific profile, and they separate radiation of different wavelengths in a similar way to a prism. One important parameter is the density of rulings which is one of the determinants of spectral resolution and useful wavelength range. The ‘image’ produced by the grating is focused onto the array detector by another collimating mirror. Some newer models of spectrometer from StellarNet (e.g. BLACK-Comet spectrometer) and now also from Ocean Optics (Torus spectrometer) use a concave grating instead of a planar one. Since the grating itself focuses the light onto the array detector, collimating mirrors are not needed. Having fewer optical components, an instrument with better stray light performance is obtained.\n\n \n\n\n \n\nThe array detector normally has rectangular ‘pixels’, orientated so that their shorter dimension is on the axis along which the different wavelengths have been separated by the monochromator, and their longer dimension is perpendicular to it. The entrance slit is positioned to have the long dimension coincident with the long dimension of the pixels. In some detectors the long pixels are in reality rows of square pixels with their electrical output combined into a single output signal. The output signal from the pixels is averaged by the detector itself over what is called ‘integration time’. The longer the integration used, the lower the irradiance that can be measured. However, the ‘dark noise’ increases with the integration time. In addition, it is possible to take several scans and average them. A coarse dark noise correction is sometimes done by subtracting the signal from special pixels at the end of the array that are not exposed to radiation. However a dark scan, with the input optics protected from the incoming radiation, should also be measured, and its value, wavelength by wavelength subtracted from the measurements. The dark noise depends on temperature. This has two implications, dark scans should be taken frequently, sometimes before or after each measurement, and the spectrometer should be allowed to warm up for some minutes before starting to take readings. Furthermore, when working outdoors it should be protected from direct sunlight, so as to keep its temperature stable and close to that at which it was calibrated. Some spectrometers have a thermoelement (TE), working according to the Peltier principle, which cools the array detector to a preset temperature and thereby stabilizes it.\nMost array spectrometers, the exception being some older models with thermoelectrically cooled detectors, are powered through the USB port. This can be the same USB link to a personal computer used to control them and retrieve the acquire spectral data. With the power delivery (PD) charging protocol now available, USB-C ports can provide much more power that the original USB 1.0 and 2.0 standards.\nFor field and mobile use a laptop is frequently used to control array spectrometers. Special software, sold by the manufacturer of the spectrometer, is frequently used to control the instrument and acquire and plot the spectra.\nFor most instruments there are also drivers and software development kits (SDK) available for developing programs for special applications. When special corrections, for example for stray light, are performed it may be necessary to acquire raw spectral data and apply corrections and calibrations off-line using other software, for example Excel or R. In some cases it is possible to control spectrometers and acquire data using a microcontroller board such as the Raspberry Pi.\nMany modern array spectrometers can communicate through Ethernet in addition to through USB. This makes it possible to control them through a local area network (LAN) or through a wide area network (WAN) such as the Internet.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nIn recent years handheld array spectroradiometers have become available that have a screen and small keyboard to control them. Nost of them are not designed to measure ultraviolet or infrared radiation but only vsisible. Several of these can be controlled wirelessly with a mobile phone through Bluetooth. Many of these are not intended for or accurate enough for use in scientific research. However, a few of them are. One example in the LI-180 from LI-COR. The proliferation of suppliers of low cost spectrometers, frequently providing incomplete descriptions and specifications, makes it hard to recommend any of them for serious use, even if some could be fine and be available in the future to provide support, repairs and updates.\n\n6.2.2.1 Measuring errors and limitations in accuracy\nArray spectroradiometers have a great advantage when quickly measuring changing radiation as they acquire all wavelengths simultaneously. This ensures that the values of spectral irradiance measured at all wavelengths are consistent. In contrast, under conditions where irradiance varies rapidly with time, the shape of the measured spectrum can get badly distorted when measured with a scanning spectroradiometer. However, array spectrometers have a serious limitation in that they cannot be built with double monochromators. As any spectroradiometer with a single monochromator, they suffer from relatively high values of stray light. Stray light originates from scattered light of incorrect wavelengths falling on a pixel of the array detector. In other words, radiation of one wavelength is detected (and measured) as radiation of a different wavelength. Perfectly scattered radiation would affect all pixels in the same way, but when there are reflections within the optical bench that are not perfectly scattered, some pixels in the array detector are more affected by stray light than others. Stray light is a critical specification when measuring UV-B in sunlight, as UV-B irradiance is very low compared to the irradiance of visible and near infra-red radiation. Consequently, if even a small proportion of visible radiation is scattered and reflected as stray light within the instrument, this stray light can generate a signal on the ‘UV-B pixels’ of the array of a magnitude similar to, or larger than, that produced by the radiation that we are trying to measure. Stray light is such a big problem that without very complicated and special corrections these instruments cannot be used at all to measure radiation in sunlight. Errors of more than 100%[^25] for biologically effective doses can be incurred even with a well calibrated instrument. Failure to take this into account has led to important mistakes, like the erroneous measurement of solar radiation at ground level by NASA researchers which was published in Geophysical Research Letters. This was most likely an artifact due to the limitations of the array spectrometer used. See the paper by D’Antoni et al. (2007) and the refutation by Stephan D. Flint et al. (2008) and the answer by D’Antoni, Rothschild, and Skiles (2008). Equally, the values of the UV-B doses used in many recent biological experiments, as reported in the publications, are suspect, since they have been based on measurements performed with single-monochromator instruments.\nGratings disperse radiation according to what are called ‘orders’. For example first order dispersion may be 10 nm/mm, second order dispersion 5 nm/mm, third order dispersion 2.5 nm/mm, and so on. The first order spectrum is what is of interest, and is what we want the array detector to see. However, any given ‘pixel’ in the array, in addition to radiation corresponding to the first order (e.g. 800 nm), also sees radiation corresponding to higher orders (e.g. 400 nm, 266.6 nm, 200 nm, and so on) if those wavelengths are present in the incoming radiation. The solution to this problem is to use ‘order-sorting filters’ in the light pass. In array spectrometers order-sorting filters may be directly coated onto the array detector, or attached to it. For example Ocean Optics spectrometers can be bought with a variable longpass order-sorting filter as an option (Figure [fig:CCD:slit]).\nAnother problem with array detector spectrometers is that the radiation may be better focused on some parts of the array than on others, and this causes changes in spectral resolution with changing wavelengths. In addition, the wavelength difference between adjacent pixels is not always the same across the whole spectrum, neither is the step size an integer number. Usually the software supplied with the instrument can generate files with data at integer steps (e.g. 1 nm, or 5 nm) but this is done by interpolating and averaging, rather than changing the measurement itself. In contrast the scanning step of scanning spectroradiometers can be controlled through its software.\nThe overall accuracy of the measurements is also reliant on the angular response of the entrance optics. For measuring spectral irradiance we generally use a cosine diffusor as entrance optics, although it is also possible to use an integrating sphere. Deviations of cosine diffusers from the theoretical angular response tend to increase at large angles from the vertical. If the spectrum of the light coming from different angles is different (e.g. sun and sky) not only the irradiance measured may be inaccurate but also the shape of the spectrum may be distorted. When measuring outdoors, the size of this error will change through a day as the sun moves across the sky. The very small cosine diffusers sold by the spectrometer manufacturers tend to be prone to large errors, and individually calibrated, high quality diffusers like the D7-SMA and D7-H-SMA from Bentham (see section 9.20 on page for full address) are preferable, although they are much more expensive (Figure [fig:Bentham:diffuser]).\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2.2 Calibration and corrections\nWhen measuring UV-B with an array spectroradiometer it is not enough to have it properly calibrated, its optical characteristics (slit function at different wavelengths, stray light properties) need to be measured and a correction algorithm developed and later applied to each measurement. This makes the use of array spectroradiometers for characterizing UV-B doses complicated and error prone. This type of use has to be attempted only by experienced operators and the correction algorithm itself requires lots of effort to develop and implement. Given the lack of standardized procedures for stray light correction, its implementation requires advanced knowledge of optics and metrology. We will first discuss spectral calibration and thereafter stray light correction procedures.\nSpectral calibration against standard lamps needs to be repeated regularly. For measurements not requiring very high precision, annual re-calibrations may be enough. However, the main consideration should be how valuable is the data that will be acquired. If the spectral sensitivity of the instrument has changed significantly from one calibration to the next, the data from all measurements done in between these calibrations are suspect, and should be discarded. Consequently if one does yearly re-calibrations one can lose one year’s worth of data, while if one does monthly re-calibrations one only risks losing one month’s worth of data. Consequently, the decision on how frequently to calibrate should, in addition to instrument stability, be based on the maximum size of the tolerable errors and on the value of the data (i.e. the cost of replacing the data if they need to be discarded).\nThe most common and stable calibration light sources are incandescent lamps (e.g. FEL lamps) with electronics in the power source which keeps the electrical power at the filament constant within very narrow margins. The distance between the lamp and the entrance optics, and their alignment, should also fall within a very narrow margin of the expected values. Calibration lamps are secondary or tertiary standards, connected by a chain of calibration steps to a standard kept at a metrology agency like NIST. Calibration lamps are supplied with spectral data about their emission characteristics. Calibration of the instrument is done by measuring the known spectrum and irradiance of the calibration lamp. Of course the output of the lamp will not exactly match the data supplied with it, because its original calibration is also subject to errors. Furthermore, there are errors deriving from slight differences between the burning conditions (current and voltage) during measurements and those when it was calibrated at the factory. Further errors can be introduced by small differences in the geometry of the optical setup. So, do not forget that calibrations are subject to errors. Furthermore, you cannot obtain an absolute estimate of calibration errors by comparing two instruments calibrated with the same lamp, unless this lamp is the primary standard.\nCalibrating a spectroradiometer in the UV-B band with a FEL lamp is not recommended, because FEL lamps emit very little UV-B. For calibration in the UV-B deuterium lamps need to be used. Irradiance emitted by deuterium lamps is less stable than that emitted by FEL lamps. For coarse calibration the use of a deuterium lamp may be enough, but for accurate calibration it is best to use FEL and deuterium lamps in tandem. The shape of the spectrum emitted by deuterium lamps is stable, by matching the irradiances at wavelengths where the emission of both types of lamps overlap, one can extend an accurate calibration to shorter wavelengths. Spectrometer manufacturers also sell calibration light sources (lamp plus electronics) that may be good for routine calibration or especially for checking that calibrations performed in an optical bench remain valid. Again, what type of calibration procedure and lamp to use will depend on the accuracy required. If we want our measurements to be within \\pm 10% of the true value we will need to use very good equipment and protocols for the calibration. If we can tolerate errors of, for example, \\pm 25%, calibrations can be less accurate.\nIt is also very important to do a wavelength calibration and to check this calibration regularly. It should not be forgotten when doing this calibration that it is affected by the temperature of the instrument as temperature affects (by thermal expansion) the dimensions of the optical bench and its components. Wavelength calibration is done based on elemental emission lines in discharge lamps (or even the sun). For quick checks low pressure mercury or germicidal lamps may be used. The manufacturers of spectrometers also sell special light sources for wavelength calibration. One should choose carefully which wavelengths to use (for example 253.652 nm, 296.728 nm, 334.148 nm, and 404.657 nm for mercury lamps, as they are simple peaks rather than multiple peaks very close together like those at 302 nm, 313 nm and 365 nm). If one desires a calibration accurate to a fraction of the wavelength step of the array one needs to fit a bell-shaped curve to the pixel showing the highest signal and those adjacent to it, to find the true location of the peak centre, most likely in-between two pixels.\nTo keep errors within \\pm 10% in the UV-B when measuring sunlight, and especially to keep errors within \\pm 10% for biologically effective doses, a good calibration is not enough when using single monochromator spectroradiometers. There is also a need to correct for stray light. If we do not correct for stray light some biologically effective doses will be overestimated by more than 100%. The ratio between stray light in the UV-B band and the maximum spectral irradiance measured in good single monochromator spectrometers is approximately 1\\times 10^{-3}, while in double monochromator spectroradiometers it can be as low as 1 \\times 10^{-6}. If time for scanning, cost and lack of portability are no obstacles, it’s preferable to use double monochromator instruments and these should also be used as the main instrument in a laboratory.\nWhen applying the stray light correction, a thorough characterization of the slit function at different wavelengths and a check of the wavelength dependence of stray light are needed. This characterization does not need to be repeated, unless changes are made to the optical bench of the instrument. So, in contrast to the spectral calibration, the stray light characterization needs to be performed only once during the lifetime of the instrument unless major repairs or modifications are made.\nIn some array spectrometers, depending on the configuration, the width of the slit function may vary with the wavelength. This can introduce errors that are very difficult to correct. In some cases it might be preferable to chose a grating giving the instrument a relatively narrow wavelength range, for example 250 nm to 500 nm if the intended use is to measure ultraviolet radiation.\nThe use and calibration of array spectroradiometers for measurement of UV-B radiation in sunlight is discussed in detail in the WMO report by Seckmeyer, Bais, Bernhard, Blumthaler, Drüke, et al. (2010). Stray light correction methods are discussed in the papers by Ylianttila et al. (2005), Coleman, Sarkany, and Walker (2008), and Kreuter and Blumthaler (2009) and the references therein.",

    "section": "6.3 Broadband sensors",
    "text": "6.3 Broadband sensors\nBroadband sensors in most cases measure irradiance in a single broad range of wavelengths or band. Most broadband sensors used in plant research are based on a photodiode, a filter to constrain the range of wavelengths reaching the photodiode and a diffuser that provides an angular response close to that proportional to the cosine of the angle of incidence of light over \\pm90^\\circ from the normal, in three dimensions.\nNot all broadband sensors measure irradiance: sensors with a different angular response that proportional to the cosine of the angle are also available. Of these, most common are those with a narrow aperture angle such as \\pm5^\\circ from the normal. Spherical diffusers are used in aquatic sciences to measure fluence rate and spherical irradiance. Least common are hemispherical diffusers used to measure hemispherical irradiance or the fluence rate on a plane.\nIn traditional multichannel broadband sensors, such as red and far-red sensors, each channel consists in a discrete photodiode and filter, with the channels sharing the same cosine diffuser.\nNot all broadband sensors rely on Silicon photodiodes. Some broadband sensors are based of photodiodes made of other semiconductor materials such as Silicon Carbide, Germanium, and Indium Gallium Arsenide. In addition, some ultraviolet sensors rely on the secondary emission from an intermediate compound to convert ultraviolet radiation into visible radiation that can be more easily detected with Silicon photodiodes. These will be discussed later as the detector choice depends on the wavelength band measured.\nAlthough many broadband sensors simply provide the raw electric current from the photodiodes as output, others have built-in amplification with a voltage output, More recent designs include analogue to digital conversion circuitry and provide as output through a digital interface. Nowadays, some suppliers even sell multiple versions of each of their sensors, differing only in the interface used to retrieve the readings. As these interfaces are unrelated to the measured quantities, they are described here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpectral response of broadband sensors\n\n\n\nThe spectral response of broadband sensors almost always differs to a larger or smaller extent from that in the definition of the quantity being measured. The consequence of this is that the calibration of any broadband sensors is not constant, it varies depending on the spectrum of the radiation being measured. In some cases these differences are so small that can be ignored, but in other cases ignoring they can introduce large biases, invalidating the measurements. In general the broader and more featureless radiation spectrum is, the less likely a large bias is. In addition, some patterns of spectral response are technically easier to create than others.\nA very frequent and grave mistake is to assume a priori that a calibration provided by the sensor supplier, e.g., for sunlight is applicable to artificial light sources, such as discharge lamps, incandescent lamps or LEDs. Some suppliers provide approximate correction factors (e.g., Apogee for sensor SQ-301X-SS) or clear warnings in the documentation, while others do not even warn users. In the case of sensors good enough to be used in research, suppliers do provide typical spectral response curves. Such curves are not guaranteed, and should be taken with a grain of salt but can be used to estimate the possible calibration errors. This does not replace a light-source specific calibration.\n\n\n\n6.3.1 Photodiode current\nThe electrical current generated by a photodiode is almost proportional to the absorbed photons of a given wavelength, until its response saturates. The dark current is extremely low. Thus, the best Si photodiodes show a linear response over several orders of magnitude of irradiance. As the current depends on the captured photons, the larger the area of the photodiode the higher the current generated. The principle of operation is similar to that of solar panels used for power generation. The diodes used in sensors have relatively small area and the generated current is small, in the order of a few mA. Thus long wiring can distort the signal or pick electrical noise from other devices. A sensitive and accurate measuring device is necessary to measure medium and low irradiances. Each sensor and sensor channel needs to be wired individually to a current measuring device with a high enough impedance not to affect to the functioning of the sensor. These sensors do not require a power supply and only two wires needed between the sensor and meter or datalogger. The time constant of the these sensors is very short, in some cases less that a ms and dependent on the capacitance of the wiring.\n\n\n6.3.2 Amplified voltage\nSome sensors have a built-in amplifier that converts the small current generated by the photodiode into a voltage, commonly in 0\\ldots 5 V or 0\\ldots 10 V. Unless the amplifier is very well designed, it can introduce a small zero offset and introduce temeprature dependence. These sensors do require power for the amplifier to operate. The wiring is less sensitive to electrical noise and a measuring device of lower sensitivity and impedance can be used without affecting the accuracy of the measurement. The time constant of the response of these sensors vary as it is mainly dependent on the design of the built-in amplifiers. It can vary from a few ms to 1 s or longer.\n\n\n6.3.3 Amplified current\nRarely used in research but frequently used in indutrial automation are amplified sensor with a current output in the range 4\\ldots 20 mA. In this protocol 4 mA corresponds to a zero reading. This relative high current makes this type of wiring rather inmune to electrical noise. The drawback is that these sensors consume more power than those using alternative approaches, making them unsuitable for battery or solar-panel powered systems.\n\n\n6.3.4 Digitital communication\nDigital communication protocols can provide two big advantages: the sharing of wiring among separate sensors or between channels in a single sensor. As data are transmitted as encoded numbers, their integrity can be checked. The most frequently used wired protocol is SDI12 (serial data interface at 1200 bit s-1). These sensors have built in circuitry for converting the current from the sensor or the amplified voltage into a digital value. Many are also able to computed time averages from individual measurements and keep the most recent value in local memory. The “measuring” device, computer or logger, queries the sensor for specific data and the sensor replies by sending a number encoded as train of binary 0 and 1 plus a code to check integrity. Each sensor has an address that identifies it within the sharing wiring and the logger or other measuring device addresses its queries to a single sensor at a time. Multiple commands can be implemented in a single sensor, even commands that change its behaviour. It allows long wiring in addition to sharing it. Its drawback is that the data rate is low, so data can be retrieved from sensors at most once every few seconds. This time increases the more sensors share the wiring as they need to be queried sequentially. Sensors implementing the SDI12 tend to be more expensive than those based on simpler approaches. On the other hand they remove the need to use loggers capable of accurate and high resolution analogue to digital conversion.\nIn addtion to SDI12 other digital electrical and communication protocols are in use for sensors. Two well-known serial protocols are RS-232 and RS-485. The first of them is point to point with no sharing of wiring and it was common in personal computers in the 1980’s and 1990’s. RS-232 even is data are sent serial through a single pair of wires, acknowledgement and synchronization takes places through additional wires. In RS-485, from around the same time, wiring can be shared and addressing and coordination requires fewer wires. These are electrical protocols. MODBUS is a comand protocol that uses RS485 and is still in use, mainly in industrial automation but occasionaly also for tasks like greenhouse automation and sensors.\n\n\n6.3.5 Miniature integrated sensors\nA newer type of sensors, originally developed for use in mobile phones and TV sets, are integrated circuits that have multiple photodiodes and the ancillary amplification and analogue to digital conversion electronics built-in. They come in SMD pacakages with footprints as small as 2\\times 3 mm. In some cases the photodiodes have interference filters deposited directly onto the silicon chip surface creating channels responsive to different wavelength bands. These sensors are extremely small with all channels tightly clustered within an area of the order of one to a few square millimetres. Some of these sensors can do simple digital data processing to convert the measurements into physical or photobiological quantities of interest. These sensors are designed to be paired to microcontrollers and communicate with them using short-range digital serial communication protocols and installed in devices. Ready to use devices, specially weather-proof ones, are not yet commercially available. Some very cheap handheld spectrometers are probably already based on these sensors, although the suppliers do not disclose their design. Small modules including a logger have been developed based on these integrated circuits. Also instructions, breakout boards, code libraries are available for different popular micro-controller-based boards like different flavours of Arduino, Rasperry Pi and ESP32. Compared to traditional sensors these modules are much cheaper and less accurate but still very versatile. For example the 14-channels AS7343 spectral sensor from ams OSRAM sells for 7 € individually and much cheaper in quantity. The USB module Yoto-Spectral from Yocto-Puce with built-logger based on this same spectral sensor sells for 60 €. These sensors are less accurate than traditional ones but the cost advantage is overwhelming allowing high replication while the built in logger makes deployment easy.\n\n\n6.3.6 Wireless communication\nThere are multiple approaches to wireless transmission of sensor data. Some rely on protocols widely used in other domains, such as Wifi, Bluetooth or even GSM. In recent years the popularization of the internet of things (IoT) has encouraged the development of protocols optimised for transmission of sparse data from sensors, including LoRa and low throughput/low energy variants of Wifi and GSM.\nSelecting the wireless protocol to use depends mainly on necessary range, data transmission throughput and the availability of power sources. The architecture, meaning which data links are wired and which ones wireless can also vary. One approach is to have individual sensors communicating wirelessly to a base station where data are collected and possibly forwarded to remote storage (e.g., Aranet’s). Alternatively, multiple sensors can be wired to a hub and the hub connected wirelessly to a router by Wifi, wired through ethernet or through GSM or some other protocol.",

    "section": "6.4 Data retrieval and logging",
    "text": "6.4 Data retrieval and logging\nOn-site data loggers with wired sensors is a common and relaible approach, both at accessible and remote sites. Data are stored locally but in most cases can be accessed locally, remotely or both. Data are normally downloaded from the logger in batches. Modern loggers with ample memory can safely store large data sets. Most loggers have an assortment of inputs, both analogue and digital making it possible to attach sensors based on a mix of different analogue and digital communication protocols. The best data loggers have analogue to digital converters (ADC) with a resolution of 24 bits and auto ranging. Some dataloggers like Campbell Scientific CR6 can take up to 100 readings per second simultaneously on more than one analogue input. They can be programmed to take measurements only under certain conditions, compute and store summaries like means and histograms instead of raw data, to power on and off instruments and control ancillary equipment like cameras. Data loggers for use in the field have been around for over 50 years and are a stable and reliable, but expensive.\nSmall loggers, with only one or two channels and built-in sensors have been available for some decades. Illumination loggers and PAR loggers are available. Most of these sensors do not provide as good a performance as separate sensors and loggers but are overall cheaper and easier to deploy, although on site data collection from multiple loggers can become time consuming. The iButton Thermocron temperature loggers in a button-cell-like case are widely used, rugged and small. Nothing like them is available for measuring light. PAR loggers are larger in size.\nSome sensors with logging capabilities are also capable of being remotely accessed. They provide the best of both worlds as data are locally stored independently of any break in communication, but can be accessed remotely to download the data, change settings or even update the firmware.",

    "section": "6.5 Summaries based on wavelength ranges",
    "text": "6.5 Summaries based on wavelength ranges\nThe rest of this section is organized with one section for each group of related measured quantities. In each of these sections the different instruments and sensors and well as computations used to compute them from spectral irradiance are presented.\n\n6.5.1 Global radiation and pyranometers\nThe term global radiation describes most of the radiation at ground level that arrives from the sun, what in meteorology is called shortwave radiation, extending from approximately 280 nm in the UV to nearly 2800–3000 nm in the IR. Pyranometers measure radiation in this range as energy irradiance (\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}).\nPyranometers are the most common radiation sensor used in meteorology, and long-term time series of global radiation data from weather stations are available. The best performing pyranometers use as sensor a blackened thermopile (multiple thermocouples in series) enclosed to isolate it from the air and external temperature changes. The thermopile behaves like a black body and warms up in response to the incident energy flux. A difference in temperature between the two sides of the thermopile generates a voltage difference approximately proportional to the energy flux. The design ensures that radiation of nearly all wavelengths in the global radiation range are nearly fully and equally absorbed. Consequently, for radiation within the range 290 nm to nearly 2800 nm a single calibration is usually valid Figure 6.1.\nIn contrast to most other radiation sensors, the spectral response of thermopile pyranometers is in close agreement with the theoretical quantity they are intended to measure. The performance of thermopile pyranometers is described using standardised “classes”, with each class having different requirements for performance and accuracy. The current ISO 9060:2018 standard, calls the classes: A, B, and C, with required minimum performance decreasing from A to C (formerly named “secondary standard”, “first class” and “second class”). Thermopiles in pyranometers are protected by one or two concentric quartz domes. Some thermopiles used to measure radiation in laboratories have more rudimentary or no protection. The best know supplier of pyranometers is Kipp. The original design of the thermopile and domes has remained nearly unchanged for decades. Versions with amplified and calibrated voltage output, amplified current output as well as digital output have been released more recently and coexist with earlier ones.\nCheaper “silicon” pyranometers work on a very different principle: a semiconductor photodiode generates a current of electrons proportional to absorbed photons. The response varies with wavelength not only because of the varying energy per photon, but also because their quantum efficiency varies with wavelength. The spectral response of these pyranometers is not flat with respect energy or photon irradinace Figure 6.1. In other words, there is a mismatch between the spectral response of the sensor and the spectral weighting of the physical quantity measured. The consequence of this is that sensor calibration is not independent of the spectrum of the radiation being measured! This is also the case with most other broadband sensors based on silicon-, silicon carbide-, and photodiodes made from other semiconductor materials.\n\n\nCode\nglobal.wb &lt;- waveband(c(280, 2800), \n                      SWF.e.fun = function(x) {1}, \n                      norm = 550, \n                      SWF.norm = 550,\n                      wb.name = \"global radiation\")\nautoplot(global.wb, range = c(100, 3500), geom = \"spct\") /\n  (autoplot(sensors.mspct[c(\"Skye_SKS1110\", \"LICOR_LI_200\", \"KIPP_CM21\")],\n            idfactor = \"Pyranometer:\",\n            range = c(100, 3500),\n            annotations =c(\"-\", \"peaks\"), \n            w.band = global.wb) +\n     theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n  ) +\n  plot_layout(axes = \"collect\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Comparison of the definition of global radiation to the spectral response of three pyranometers. The Kipp CM21 pyranometer is a thermopile-based instrument with an spectral response approximating the theoretical response. The Skye SKS1110 and LI-COR LI-200 are based on silicon photodiodes and even if their spectral response differs drastically from the expected one, they are calibrated to give a reading approximating global radiation only when used in sunlight.\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal radiation cannot normally be computed from measured spectral irradiance, as spectrometers in common use do not have a wide enough wavelength sensitivity range.\n\n\n6.5.2 Photosynthetic radiation and quantum sensors\nGiven the central role of photosynthesis, multiple radiation quantities to quantify radiation that can drive the light reactions of photosynthesis have been proposed over the years. A few competing quantities remain currently in use. McCree’s definition of the photon irradiance of photosynthetically active radiation (Q_\\mathrm{PAR}) is overwhelmingly preferred nowadays. Q_\\mathrm{PAR} is frequently described as photosynthetic photon flux density and abbreviated PPFD. PPFD is not used outside the plant sciences, “photon flux density” widely accepted name is “photon irradiance” and its symbol is Q. However, several other quantities can be found in the current and specially past scientific literature on plant biology, plant ecology and meteorology. Some of them, locationally, even under the same name “photosynthetically active radiation” or PAR as McCree’s.\nEarly on, given the availability of illuminance sensors, values expressed in lux and foot candles were frequently used. In meteorology pyranometers, and in Physics thermopiles, described above, have been in use for a long time, and were also used to report energy irradiances. Both of these approaches are inadequate and have been mostly abandoned in studies related to photosynthesis and plant biology.\nThe earliest and simplest approach that considered the response to light of photosynthesis was to constrain the range of wavelengths over which spectral energy irradiance was integrated to those contributing to photosynthesis, however, with no agreement on the best range of wavelengths to use.\nSpectral photon irradiance can also be integrated over a wavelength range. As described in chapter XXXX, the use of photon or energy as base of expression to quantify radiation are not equivalent, and interconversion is only possible if the light spectrum shape is known. As for any photochemically driven reaction, absorption of photons excites chlorophyll molecules and this excitation energy drives the chemical reactions. Thus, from a mechanistic perspective photon irradiance should be preferred. Still in the early 1970’s there was no consensus and multiple ways of describing the radiation in studies with plants, including photosynthesis, where in use. To make things worse, interconversion was in most cases impossible as spectral information was not available (McCree1972a?), McCree (1972), (McCree1976?). McCree’s proposal of PAR aimed to address this problem, and was based on a large set of measurements of the spectral response of photosynthesis.\nIn other words, PAR, as defined by McCree (1972) is the integral over wavelengths of the spectral photon irradiance\nQ_\\mathrm{PAR} = \\int_\\mathrm{400\\,nm}^\\mathrm{700\\,nm} Q(\\lambda)\\ d \\lambda\nand is not directly equivalent to the integral of the spectral energy irradiance over the same range of wavelengths,\nE_\\mathrm{PAR} \\neq E_\\mathrm{PhR} = \\int_\\mathrm{400\\,nm}^\\mathrm{700\\,nm} E(\\lambda)\\ d \\lambda\nwhere we E_\\mathrm{PhR} is photosynthetic energy irradiance as defined by (Gabrielsen1940?) and no longer in use in plant and agriculture research but still used in meteorology, also under the name of PAR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPAR as defined by McCree (1972) is based on a very simple biological spectral weighting function (BSWF) according to which all photons in \\lambda\\ \\mathrm{in} 400\\ldots700\\,\\mathrm{nm} drive photosynthesis with equal efficiency Figure 6.2.\n\n\nCode\nautoplot(PAR(), unit.in = \"photon\", unit.out = \"photon\") | \n  autoplot(PAR(), unit.in = \"photon\", unit.out = \"energy\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: The biological spectral weighting function (BSWF) of PAR as defined by McCree, plotted as normalised response per energy quantum (or photon) and per energy of incident light.\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, the PAR BSWF used with photon irradiance, is implicit in the equation above, which could be written also as\nQ_\\mathrm{PAR} = \\int_\\mathrm{400\\,nm}^\\mathrm{700\\,nm} a_q(\\lambda)\\times Q(\\lambda)\\ d \\lambda\nwhere\na_q(\\lambda) = 1\\ \\forall\\ 400 \\leq \\lambda \\leq 700\nThat the action per photon is invariant with wavelengths implies that the effectiveness of energy depends inversely on wavelength based on Plank’s law. This makes it possible to re-express the PAR BSWF in energy units. However, the conversion is not unique, as it needs to be normalised based on a reference wavelength. Below, 550 nm, the wavelength at the centre of the 400\\ldots 700 nm wavelength range, was chosen rather arbitrarily.\nE_\\mathrm{PAR} = \\int_\\mathrm{400\\,nm}^\\mathrm{700\\,nm} a_e(\\lambda)\\times E(\\lambda)\\ d \\lambda\nwhere a_e(\\lambda) = \\lambda / 550 when using \\lambda = 550 nm as normalization wavelength for the BSWF.\nThe purpose of this explanation is to demonstrate that PAR is intrinsically defined as a photon irradiance, not as a wavelength range as sometimes erroneously assumed. PAR should always be reported as a photon irradiance (Q_\\mathrm{PAR} = PPFD) and a different name used for the energy irradiance E_\\mathrm{PhR}, if used at all.\nFor sunlight, when using \\lambda = 550\\,\\mathrm{nm} for normalization, the difference between E_\\mathrm{PhR} and E_\\mathrm{PAR} is quantitatively rather small, but for some other light sources the difference is too large to be ignored.\n\n\nThe definition of PAR proposed by McCree (1972) was inspired by how illuminance, the brightness of light as perceived by humans is routinely measured. He proposed a definition based on numerous action spectra of photosynthesis he had measured in leaves of several different crop plants. These action spectra were based on absorbed photons rather than on the incident photon flux. He decided to ignore the effect of variation in absorptance on the basis that absorptance is very high in leaves of healthy plants. Thus, when we use PAR to quantify light we assume all incident photons in the range 400\\ldots 700 nm absorbed and equally effective.\nPAR does not attempt to describe the light response of photosynthesis of plants of any given species growing in any specific environment. PAR is a technical method for quantification of light in a way relevant to plants in general, approximating the response expected from important crop plants just enough for it to be useful. In this respect, it is similar to how the brightness of illumination is assessed based on the typical response of human vision, ignoring variation among individuals.\nPAR sensors are in most cases based on silicon photodiodes filtered to change the spectral response to better approximate that of the PAR BSWF. There is considerable variation in how close this match is, although in no case the deviation is as extreme as with photodiode-based pyranometers Figure 6.3. Thus, calibrations are dependent on the light spectrum to variable extents, and these deviations should be taken into account when not using the sensors under the light source they are calibrated to. In most cases, manufacturers calibrate PAR sensors for sunlight.\n\n\nCode\nautoplot(PAR(), range = c(300, 800), geom = \"spct\",\n            unit.in = \"photon\", unit.out = \"photon\") /\n  (autoplot(sensors.mspct[c(\"LICOR_LI_190R\", \"apogee_sq_500\", \"apogee_sq_100X\")],\n            idfactor = \"PAR sensor:\",\n            w.band = PAR(),\n            range = c(300, 800),\n            annotations =c(\"-\", \"peaks\"), \n            unit.out = \"photon\") +\n     theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n  ) +\n  plot_layout(axes = \"collect\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Comparison of McCree’s defintion of photosinthetically active radiation (PAR) to the spectral response of three PAR (=quantum) sensors. The three sensors are based on silicon photodiodes, with different filters. The Apogee SQ-100X is a low cost sensor while the other two are more expensive and using special optical filters. They are sold calibrated to give a reading approximating PAR when used in sunlight. The errors incurred when using such calibrations to measure light from other sources depends both on the sensor and on the light source.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome years after McCree proposed the use of PAR, another quantity was proposed using the actual average of the action spectra measured by McCree as BSWF. It was originally named Yield Photon Flux (originally YPF, here PQYR for photosynthetic-quantum-yield weighted radiation). As McCree published two different mean action spectra, one for field-grown crop plants and one for growth-chamber-grown crop plants we end up with two new variations on photosynthetically active radiation. This approach also extends the wavelength range to that in the measured action spectra. No broadband sensors are available for measuring PQYR and needs to be measured with a spectroradiometer or a PAR sensor with a light-source specific calibration. (xxxx?) Bugbee et al tested the difference….\n\n\nCode\nautoplot(PAR(\"McCree.field.mean\"), \n         unit.in = \"photon\", unit.out = \"photon\") | \n  autoplot(PAR(\"McCree.chamber.mean\"), \n           unit.in = \"photon\", unit.out = \"photon\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: The mean action spectra reported by McCree for leaves from field- and controlled-environment-grown crop plants and later used in the definition of YFD (PQYR eher). Normalised response as \\mathrm{CO_2} fixed per absorbed photon is plotted on the central wavelegth of 25 nm wide bands of illuminations used. The curves are interpolating natural spline.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt must be kept in mind that the original spectra were measured under single colour light in bands 25 nm wide spaced by 25 to 30 nm. Differently to with McCree’s definition, when calculating these quantities the weights (a_q(\\lambda)) applied are extracted directly from the mean action spectrum curve, as for PAR, ignoring the difference between incident and absorbed photons. The weights are different for energy and photon spectral irradiance, corresponding to action spectra being expressed per unit energy or per photon (or mole of photons).\nQ_\\mathrm{PQYR} = \\int_{\\mathrm{350\\,nm}}^\\mathrm{750\\,nm} a_q(\\lambda)\\times\nQ(\\lambda)\\ d \\lambda\nA more recent variation on PAR is extended PAR (ePAR) (ZhenXXX?) and justified in that far-red photons can drive photosynthesis. Extended PAR is based on the same simple photon-based BSWF as McCree’s PAR but with the wavelength range extended by 50 nm into the far red region, thus, based on a wavelength range of 400\\ldots 750 nm.\nQ_\\mathrm{ePAR} = \\int_\\mathrm{400\\,nm}^\\mathrm{750\\,nm} Q(\\lambda)\\ d \\lambda\nHowever, the role of far red light in photosynthesis is synergistic, known as Emerson’s effect. Far red light cannot drive photosynthesis on its own, but only when shorter wavelengths are concurrently present with high enough photon irradiance. Simple ePAR sensors like the SQ-610-SS from Apogee Figure 6.5 ignore this, and do give an ePAR reading higher than zero under pure far-red radiation from LEDs and possibly too high readings under light from incandescent lamps. When computing extended PAR from spectral data, the VIS light requirement can be considered in the calculations and the value capped when needed to account for the synergistic nature of the response to far red. We use xPAR to describe the constrained version of ePAR. The factor 1.4 used in the equation below is a coarse approximation.\nQ_\\mathrm{xPAR} = \\mathrm{min}\\left(1.4 \\times \\int_\\mathrm{400\\,nm}^\\mathrm{700\\,nm} Q(\\lambda)\\ d \\lambda,\\ \\ \\\n\\int_\\mathrm{400\\,nm}^\\mathrm{750\\,nm} Q(\\lambda)\\ d \\lambda\\right)\nApogee sells a two channel sensor, PAR + FR, (S2-141-SS) that makes this check possible.\n\n\nCode\nautoplot(PAR(\"ePAR\"), range = c(300, 800), geom = \"spct\",\n         unit.in = \"photon\", unit.out = \"photon\") /\n  (autoplot(sensors.mspct[c(\"apogee_sq_610\")],\n            idfactor = \"Pyranometer:\",\n            range = c(300, 800),\n            annotations =c(\"-\", \"peaks\", \"summaries\"), \n            w.band = list(ePAR = PAR(\"ePAR\")),\n            unit.out = \"photon\") +\n     theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n  ) +\n  plot_layout(axes = \"collect\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: Comparison of the definition of the ePAR to the spectral response of one single-channel ePAR sensor and a two-channel PAR + FR sensor. The two Apogee sensors are based on filterd silicon photodiodes, they are callibrated to give a reading approximating ePAR, PAR and FR in 700 to 750 nm when used in sunlight.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the proposal of PAR by McCree two quantities based on similar wavelength ranges were proposed as relevant to photosynthesis, but based on integrating spectral energy irradiance. The (Gabrielsen1940?) used the same wavelength range as McCree’s PAR (400\\ldots 700 nm) while that proposed by Nichiporovich used a slightly wider band of wavelengths one (380\\ldots 710 nm).\nWith a spectroradiometer we can measure the spectral energy irradiance, and if necessary convert it into spectral photon irradiance, and apply any of the equations above to obtain measured values for the different quantities described above. Table 6.1 shows the results of applying this approach to several different natural and artificial light sources. Most important is that the differences among them depend on the spectrum of the light source.\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.1: Various photon irradiances (Q_i) used to quantify light useful for photosynthesis.

No PAR sensor matches exactly the spectral response in the definition of PAR or the cosine response. The best sensors provide a good approximation and simpler (usually cheaper) sensors deviate more from PAR’s definition and at low angles of incidence.\nIn any light with a broad spectrum and no high peaks or deep valleys a good PAR sensor will measure reasonably well PAR even if calibrated for sunlight. In contrast, a simple PAR sensor calibrated in sunlight can be off by as much as 30% if used to measure light from an incandescent lamp. If used to measure a light source with a narrow emission spectrum, such as a low pressure sodium lamp or single colour LED, the error can be even larger. Such problems can be resolved by use of light-source specific calibrations. Taken to the extreme, if the light spectrum does not change, any sensor, even a bare photodiode that responds to some of this light can be calibrated and used to measure PAR. Even with the best PAR sensors, measurements of light from single-colour LEDs emitting at some wavelengths, specially those near the boundaries near 400 and 700 nm, can be biased. When measuring single-colour LEDs using a broadband sensor it is recommended to validate the sensor calibration against a parallel measurement against a spectroradiometer. As photodiodes have an almost perfectly linear response to irradiance, in most cases a single point calibration is enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident vs. absorbed photons\n\n\n\nPAR photon irradiance quantifies the incident flux of photons and is usually measured on a horizontal plane. When studying the mechanism of photosynthesis, in many cases it must be remembered that PAR irradiance can be very far from being a measure of the flux of absorbed photons per unit leaf area. Leaves differing in chlorophyll concentration per unit area, thickness, mesophyll cell size and shapes, hairiness, cuticular waxes, and any other feature that modifies their optical properties, can absorb different proportions of the PAR photons incident on their surfaces. These differences as well as differences in irradiance at the leaf plane due to differences in leaf display angle or in light interception as a result of canopy structure must be taken into consideration when interpreting responses to PAR. In fact, leaf absorptance is dynamic as it depends on the accumulation movements of chloroplasts that have time constants in the order of minutes.",

    "text": "6.6 Photon and energy ratios\nOne way of coarsely describing the shape of spectra is to express irradiance in one region of the spectrum relative to that in a different region. In photobiology photon ratios are the main interest, while in some applications energy ratios or photon to energy ratios are relevant.\nWe can, for example, compute the red to far-red (R:FR) photon ratio, relevant to responses mediated by the photoreceptor phytochromw, as the ratio between two photon irradiances.\nQ_\\mathrm{red}:Q_\\mathrm{far\\ red} = \\frac{\\int_{\\lambda = 650\\,\\mathrm{nm}}^{\\lambda = 670\\,\\mathrm{nm}} Q(\\lambda) \\,d\\lambda}{\\int_{\\lambda = 725\\,\\mathrm{nm}}^{\\lambda = 745\\,\\mathrm{nm}} Q(\\lambda) \\,d\\lambda}\nwhere \\lambda is wavelength, Q photon (= quantum) is irradiance and Q(\\lambda) spectral photon irradiance. In this example using the most frequently used 20-nm-wide wavelength bands centred at \\lambda = 660\\,\\mathrm{nm} for red light and at \\lambda = 735\\,\\mathrm{nm} for far red light (). (It is possible to use in place of irradiances, time integrated quantities such as fluence, as long as the time and spatial bases of expression used for the numerator and denominator are the same).\nTwo main kinds of photon ratios are in use in plant photobiology. Ratios like the red to far-red (R:FR) photon ratio computed above in which the photon irradiances in the numerator and denominator are for non-overlapping wavelength regions, and ratios such as the ultraviolet-B to total ultraviolet (UVB:UV) photon ratio where the wavelength band used for the numerator is a spectral region within that used for the denominator. Ratios between non-overlapping regions can in principle take any unit-less numeric value in -\\inf\\ldots\\inf while ratios in which the numerator wavelength range is nested in the wavelength range of the denominator can take at most numeric values in 0\\ldots1.\nIt is also possible, although less common, to define ratios based on energy. It important to keep in mind that a photo ratio and an energy ratio based on the same wavelength ranges will differ. As seen for the conversion between photon and energy irradiances in section XXXXX, the conversion is possible only if the spectral irradiance is know as it is a function of wavelength. For example, based on a sunlight spectrum for the mid-morning in the Spring in Helsinki the UV-B:PAR photon ratio of 1.9 ‰ corresponds to an UV-B:PAR energy ratio of 3.2 ‰.\nFinally, photon to energy ratios are also in use. In this case the range of wavelengths used for the numerator and denominator are the same but the irradiance in the numerator is expressed as a flux of photons and that in the denominator as a flux of energy. As the energy per photon depends on wavelength, the photon to energy ratio increases with increasing wavelength.\nAlthough less accurate than a spectrum with higher wavelength resolution, ratios provide summaries that are easier to interpret and analyse, and in many cases also easier to measure. One should, however, be careful with the interpretation of ratios as they are coarse summaries. Ratios discard important information about the shape of the spectrum as a whole and consequently the relationship between photon ratios and biological responses frequently is interpretable only when regions of the spectrum are reasonably close to those in the daylight spectrum.\nIt is very important to conduct experiments under realistic environmental conditions, i.e., conditions relevant to the aims of a study. For studies to be relevant to plants growing outdoors, these conditions include the daylight spectrum, while in contrast, for controlled environment farming, a good match to the spectrum of the artificial light used.\nFor the assessment and control of experimental conditions, it is helpful—besides using biologically effective irradiances and exposures—to calculate photon ratios to assess the similarity or not of illumination. Photon ratios inform succinctly about differences among experimental conditions or between experimental conditions and\nAs for example shown in section 8.2.7 on page and in table [tab:typical:irrad:values] on page. For the calculation of these ratios, it is essential to use the same quantity of radiation or the same weighting procedure, i.e. energetic units or photon units for the ratios being compared.\n\n6.6.1 A practical example\nThe importance of indicating the type of sensor and its orientation is exemplified by the changing ratio of fluence rate to irradiance throughout a day (Figure [fig:fluence:rate:irradiance]). At noon, when the sun is high in the sky the ratio is at its minimum. Even then the ratio remains larger than one because, other than at the equator, the midday sun never reaches the zenith and because the sensor will also always receive diffuse radiation from the whole sky. We can say that when measuring solar radiation the fluence rate will always be numerically larger than the irradiance. Towards both ends of the day the ratio reaches its maximum value because irradiance is being measured on a horizontal plane but the sun is near the horizon. During twilight, particles in the atmosphere will make the distribution of solar radiation more even, allowing a relatively large area of the sky to remain bright, and the ratio decreases again.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n6.6.2 Measuring fluence rate and radiance\nSpherical sensors, as needed for measuring fluence rate, also called scalar irradiance, are not common. LI-COR (Lincoln, NE, USA) sells a spherical quantum sensor (LI-193) that can be submerged, and Biospherical Instruments Inc. (San Diego, CA, USA) makes both PAR- (e.g. QSL-2100 and QSL-2200, terrestrial; QSP series with models that can be submerged to thousands of metres) and also narrowband spherical sensors for measuring UV- and visible radiation fluence rate. Biospherical Instruments Inc. also makes radiance sensors with input optics that have a very narrow acceptance angle. Figure [fig:AMOUR:entrance:optics] shows the different entrance optics available for one series of sensors from Biospherical Instruments. Most broadband UV sensors and entrance optics for spectroradiometers follow a cosine response. L. O. Björn (1995) describes a method for estimating fluence rate from three or six irradiance measurements at a series of specific angles.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n6.6.3 Sensor output\nRadiometer sensors can have either analog or digital outputs. Some sensors with an analogue output have an amplifier next to the detector, others do not. Sensors with an analog output are usually connected to a voltmeter or a datalogger. Some digital sensors are really complete radiometers with a digital output. Examples of radiometers with digital outputs, are shown in Figure [fig:AMOUR]. RS-232 and USB are digital interfaces frequently used to attach these sensors to personal computers[^19].\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n6.6.4 Calibration\nTo calibrate radiation sensors the relationship must be determined between the electrical signal produced by a sensor and the amount of radiation impinging on that sensor. The physical value of irradiance, , of the incoming radiation in energy units, is obtained by “comparison” of a measurement X with that of a calibrated radiation source X_\\mathrm{lamp}, {E_{\\mathrm{}}}= {E_{\\mathrm{lamp}}} \\cdot \\frac{X\\cdot a}{X_\\mathrm{lamp}} where {E_{\\mathrm{lamp}}} is the calibration file of the lamp provided by the calibration survey. The factor a accounts for any difference in the lamp to sensor distance between the survey’s calibration and your own measurement of the lamp. In most modern instruments this “comparison” is implicitly done by the software in the instrument itself, or the computer it is attached to, by multiplying the electrical signal from the detector with a calibration constant. If this is not the case, it is necessary to correct all raw measurements, here X and X_\\mathrm{lamp}, before making any further calculations, for example, by subtracting the measurement of dark current (the sensor reading in the dark).\nAlthough photons can be counted using a photomultiplier and appropriate electronics, this approach does not provide an absolute measurement. Some photons are always missed and false counts are included due to thermal excitation. Therefore, absolute calibration of radiation meters can only be provided in energetic terms. For this purpose so-called “blackbody radiators” of known temperature are used, since they depend only on temperature for the total radiation as well as its spectral distribution. Blackbody radiators used for the calibration of lamps, are then available for purchase by scientists for use as secondary standards.\nIn the case of broadband sensors used to measure biologically-effective irradiances or selected bands of the spectrum, the calibration is usually carried out by comparison to readings from a calibrated spectroradiometer under a radiation source with a spectrum as similar as possible to the one which will be measured with the broadband sensor (e.g. sunlight). To calibrate spectroradiometers, in addition to a spectral-irradiance calibration against one or more lamps (with a continuous spectrum, such as an incandescent lamp), it is necessary to do a wavelength calibration against the sun or a lamp (with a an emission spectrum with discrete, narrow and stable peaks, such as a low pressure mercury lamp).\n\n\n6.6.5 Further reading\nL. O. Björn and Vogelmann (1996) treat the same subjects as this section, but in more depth.

    "text": "6.7 Actinometry\nActinometers are chemical systems for the measurement of light and ultraviolet radiation. They do not need to be calibrated by the user, and thus do not require the purchase of an expensive standard lamp with an expensive power supply. Standardization has usually been taken care of by those who have designed the actinometer. Another advantage is that their geometry can more easily be adjusted to the measurement problem. The shape of a liquid actinometer can be made to correspond to the overall shape of the irradiated object under study.\nIn many cases, it is of interest to study a suspension or solution that can be put in an ordinary cuvette for spectrophotometry or fluorimetry, and the actinometer solution can be put into a similar cuvette. A large number of actinometers have been devised. Kuhn, Braslavsky, and Schmidt (1989) lists, briefly describes and gives references for 67 different systems of which they recommend five. In general, actinometers are sensitive to short-wave radiation (&lt;500 nm) and insensitive to long-wave radiation (&gt;500 nm). Insensitivity to long-wave radiation can be both a drawback and an advantage, but by choosing the best actinometer for a particular purpose we can avoid their disadvantages. One advantage of using an actinometer insensitive to long wave radiation is that we can use it for UV work under illumination visible to the human eye, without disturbing the measurement. Here we shall concentrate on the most popular actinometer for ultraviolet radiation—the potassium ferrioxalate or potassium iron(III) oxalate actinometer. In addition to using it directly in some experiments, we can use it for checking the calibration of other instruments, such as spectroradiometers.\nThe description below is sufficient for a researcher starting to work in the field. For more detailed information one should consult Parker (1953; Hatchard and Parker 1956; Lee and Seliger 1964; Goldstein and Rabani 2008). Complete recipes have also been published, e.g., Seliger and McElroy (1965; Jagger 1967). In the ferrioxalate actinometer the following photochemical reaction is exploited:\n\n\\frac{1}{2} (COO)_2^{2-} + Fe^{3+} + photon \\rightarrow CO_2 + Fe^{2+}\nor\nOxalate ion + Fe(III) ion + radiation \\rightarrow carbon dioxide + Fe(II) ion\n\n\nThe quantum yield for this reaction (i.e., the number of iron ions reduced per photon absorbed) is slightly wavelength dependent but close to 1.26 in the spectral region, 250–500 nm, where the ferrioxalate actinometer is used. Usually a 1-cm layer of 0.006 M ferrioxalate solution is used. Quantum yield and the fraction of radiation (perpendicular to the 1 cm layer) absorbed are shown in Table [tab:ferrioxlate].\nAs seen from Table [tab:actinometer] the sensitivity of this actinometer (column to the right) is constant throughout most of the UV range, which makes it very convenient for our work.\nThe amount of Fe(II) formed can be measured spectrophotometrically after the addition of phenanthroline, which gives a strongly absorbing yellow complex with Fe(II) ions.\nThe ferrioxalate (actually potassium ferrioxalate) for the actinometer is prepared by mixing 3 volumes of 1.5 M potassium oxalate (COOK_{2}) with 1 volume of 1.5 M FeCl_3 and stirring vigorously. This step and all the following procedures involving ferrioxalate should be carried out under red light (red fluorescent tubes or LEDs). The precipitated should be dissolved in a minimal amount of hot water and the solution allowed to cool for crystallization (this crystallization should be repeated twice more). Potassium ferrioxalate can also be purchased ready-made, but the price difference encourages self-fabrication. The following is a recipe for the three solutions required to carry out actinometry (see Goldstein and Rabani 2008 for a different procedure and other quantum yields):\nSolution A: Dissolve 2.947 g of the purified and dried K_3Fe(III) oxalate in 800 ml distilled water, add 100 ml 0.5 M sulfuric acid, and dilute the solution to 1000 ml. This gives 0.006 M actinometer solution, which is suitable for measurement of ultraviolet radiation.\nSolution B: The phenanthroline solution to be used for developing the colour with Fe(II) ions should be 0.1% w/v 1:10 phenanthroline monohydrate in distilled water.\nSolution C: Prepare an acetate buffer by mixing 600 ml of 0.5 M sodium acetate with 360 ml of 0.5 M H_2SO_4.\nSolution A is irradiated with the radiation to be measured. The geometries of both the container and of the radiation are important and must be taken into account when evaluating the result. The simplest case is when the radiation is collimated, the container a flat spectrophotometer cuvette, the radiation strikes one face of the cuvette perpendicularly, and no radiation is transmitted. Even in this case one has to distinguish between whether the cuvette or the beam has the greater cross section, and correct for reflection in the cuvette surfaces. The irradiation time should be adjusted so that no more than 20% of the iron is reduced (this corresponds to an absorbance of about 0.66). In the following we shall assume that we use an ordinary fused-silica or quartz spectrophotometer cuvette with 10 mm inner thickness and containing 3 ml actinometer solution.\nAfter the irradiation and mixing of the actinometer solution, 2 ml of the irradiated solution is mixed with 2 ml of solution B and 1 ml of solution C, and then diluted to 20 ml with distilled water. After 30 minutes the absorbance at 510 nm is measured against a blank made up in the same way with unirradiated solution A. An absorbance of 0.5 corresponds to 0.905 \\mumol Fe^{2+}. It is a good idea to check this relationship with known amounts of FeSO_4 if you have not previously checked your spectrophotometer for accuracy and linearity. You should not use any absorbance above 0.65.\nExample of calculation: 3 ml of 0.006 M actinometer solution are irradiated by parallel rays of 300 nm UV-B impinging at right angles to one surface (and not able to enter any other surface). The radiation cross section intercepted by the solution is 2 cm^2. Five minutes of irradiation produces an absorbance of 0.6. This corresponds to 0.6 \\cdot 0.905/0.5 \\mumol = 1.086 \\mumol Fe^{2+}, but since we have taken 2 out of the 3 ml actinometer solution for analysis, multiply by 3/2 to get the total amount of Fe^{2+} formed. Throughout the UV-B region the quantum yield is 1.26, so this corresponds to absorption of 3 \\cdot 1.086/2/1.26 \\mumol photons. Reflection from the surface is estimated to be 7% (by application of Snell’s law, or law of refraction, giving the angle of refraction for an angle of incidence at the boundary of two media like water and glass). None of the radiation penetrates the solution to the rear surface, since the solution thickness is 1 cm. Therefore the incident radiation is 3 \\cdot 1.086/(1.26 \\cdot 0.93 \\cdot 2) \\mumol = 1.390 \\mumol radiation incident on 2 cm^2 in 5 minutes, and the photon irradiance (quantum flux density, in this case equal to the photon fluence rate, since the rays are parallel and at right angles to the surface) is 1.390/(2\\cdot5) \\mumol/cm^2/min = 0.1390 \\mumol/cm^2/min = 10000 \\cdot 0.1390/60 \\mumol/m^2/s = 23.2 \\mumol/m^2/s.\nA. D. Kirk and Namasivayam (1983) point out errors that might arise if a more concentrated actinometer solution is used, in order to absorb more light at long wavelengths, and how these errors can be minimized. If an actinometer much more concentrated than 0.006 M is used, the quantum yield is lower, and we do not recommend this for UV research. Goldstein and Rabani (2008), using 0.06 M actinometer solution, find almost the same quantum yield (1.24) from 250 to 365 nm, but much higher (1.47) from 205 to 240 nm; the latter in marked contrast to the values of Fernández, Figuera, and Tobar (1979) in the table above, so measurements below 250 nm should be regarded with caution. Bowman and Demas (1976) warn against exposure of the phenanthroline solution to UV, and even against the fluorescent room lighting.\nChemical or biological systems (mostly in a solid state) for recording solar radiation and particularly radiation, are widely employed for estimating the exposure of people, leaves in a plant canopy, and other objects which for various reasons are not easily amenable to measurements with electronic devices. These chemical devices are generally referred to as dosimeters rather than actinometers, even if there is no defined delimitation between these categories. As the construction, calibration, and use of chemical and other dosimeters have been the subject of frequent reviewing (Bérces et al. 1999; Horneck et al. 1996; Marijnissen and Star 1987), we shall not dwell on them here, only stress that their radiation sensitive components can be either chemical substances (natural such as DNA or provitamin D, or artificial) or living cells (e.g., various spores and bacteria).",

    "section": "6.8 Dosimeters",
    "text": "6.8 Dosimeters\nBroadband dosimeters have been developed to quantify exposure to UV radiation based either upon the photochemical degradation of chemical compounds and plastic films or using biological techniques involving damage to DNA. The range of experimental methods has been described by Dunne (1999) and A. Parisi et al. (2010). The most practical and effective dosimeters for plant studies include the use of plastic films of polysulphone (PS) and poly 2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide (polyphenylene oxide or PPO) (see Geiss 2003; A. Parisi, Schouten, and Turnbull 2010) and the determination of spore viability after UV exposure (see e.g. Quintern et al. 1992, 1994, 1997; Furusawa et al. 1998).\nA commercially available UV-dosimetry system ‘Viospor’ (Biosense, Germany) uses the DNA molecules of microbial spores immobilised in a film mounted in a protective casing with a cosine corrected filter system to provide a measurement of biologically-weighted UV exposure (Figure [fig:UV:dosimeters:VS]). Viospor sensors are available as two types: Viospor blue-line types I-IV which provide estimates of the CIE erythemal exposure (as MED, J m-2, and SED) at a range of exposure levels from seconds to several days, and Viospor red-line which use the DNA damage action spectrum (Setlow 1974) to estimate the DNA damaging capacity of UV-B and UV-C radiation and the efficiency of UV-C germicidal lamps. After exposure, films are incubated in bacterial growth medium to stimulate spore germination and the production of proteins that are stained for densitometric quantification. Exposed dosimeters are returned to the supplier for analysis (BioSense, Dr. Hans Holtschmidt, Laboratory for Biosensory Systems, Postfach 5161, D-53318 Bornheim, Germany. phone: +49-228-653809, fax: +49-228-653809, mailto:mail@biosense.de, internet: http://www.biosense.de).\n\n \n\nSmall dosimeters have also been constructed from 30–45 film of the thermoplastic polysulphone and can be used to determine exposure by measuring the increase in absorbance at 330 nm (Geiss 2003; A. Parisi et al. 2010) ideally using an integrating sphere to minimise the effects of scattering (Figure [fig:UV:dosimeters:PS]). Dosimeters can be calibrated in sunlight by comparison with erythemally-calibrated broadband radiometers or against lamp sources using a double monochromator spectroradiometer. Ideally, the calibration should be determined under field conditions appropriate for plant studies and if calibrated outside in sunlight the calibration is only accurate under the prevailing atmospheric ozone column as this modifies the UV spectrum. An erythemal dose can be calculated from 40 polysulphone film using a relationship of the form (see Geiss 2003):\n\\mathrm{Radiation\\ amount}\\ ({\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}}})  = 8025\\, (\\Delta \\mathrm{A}_{330})^2 + 1980.8\\, \\Delta \\mathrm{A}_{330}\nwhere is the absorbance at 330 nm before exposure (which should be between 0.105 and 0.133) minus the absorbance at 330 nm after exposure plus a further 24 h in the dark. The film may also be calibrated against other action spectra.\nAccuracy of polysulphone dosimetry has been reported to be \\pm10% if is &lt;0.3 but decreases to \\pm30% for up to 0.4 (Diffey 1987). Greater variability in occurs with increasing duration of exposure and dosimeters saturate at sub-tropical sites in less than one day. However, they have also been modified with a filter to provide an extended dynamic range of exposure (over 3 to 6 days) without the need to replace the dosimeter due to saturation (Alfio V. Parisi and Kimlin 2004). Polysulphone dosimeters have been combined with a PAR dosimeter to investigate the visible and UV radiation environment of plants (A. V. Parisi, Wong, and Randall 1998; A. V. Parisi, Galea, and Randall 2003) and miniature versions have also been developed: 1.5~{\\mathrm{cm}} \\times 1.0~{\\mathrm{cm}} with an exposure of a 6 mm disc of polysulphone (A. Parisi et al. 2010).\n\n \n\nFor longer exposure periods, dosimeters using an alternative plastic film, PPO, have been found more suitable as they saturate at sub-tropical locations after 5–10 days. The change in absorbance of PPO is quantified at 320 nm and it has been successfully calibrated to erythemal exposures (Lester et al. 2003) and by using a mylar (polyester) filter for estimation of UV-A exposures (Turnbull and Schouten 2008). Both PS and PPO dosimeters have been investigated for underwater use where PPO has been considered viable when calibrated under water (but not using a calibration in air) and under the relevant ozone column conditions of the study (Schouten, Parisi, and Turnbull 2007, 2008). The duration of use of PPO dosimeters in air at sub-tropical locations has been extended from 5 to 10 days by the use of neutral density filters (A. Parisi, Schouten, and Turnbull 2010; Schouten, Parisi, and Turnbull 2010).\nThe use of properly calibrated UV dosimeters can be particularly valuable in plant studies when long-term use of spectroradiometers and broadband radiometers is restricted by availability of electrical supplies or by physical constraints.",

    "text": "6.9 Thermopiles\nMost thermopiles have a flat response to (energy) irradiance across a wide range wavelengths. They are arrays of thermocouples formed between two different metal alloys. In a thermopile some couples are painted white and some black (or some other arrangement is used to generate a temperature difference dependent on absorbed energy), and the difference in temperature induced by the absorption of radiation by the black regions generates an electrical signal. A single thermocouple produces a very small signal, but connecting them in series generates a large signal that is easier to measure. Thermopiles can be either small for use in the laboratory or larger, and protected by a quartz dome for use in the field. Thermopile pyranometers are used to measure solar radiation in the range 285 to 2800 nm. Examples of such instruments are the pyranometers in the CMP series from Kipp & Zonen. Thermopile pyranometers are standard instruments in weather stations. Thermopiles can be also used to measure the (energy) irradiance of monochromatic radiation, including radiation, if the dome or ‘window’ is made from an transparent material.",

    "section": "6.10 Broadband instruments",
    "text": "6.10 Broadband instruments\nUV broadband radiometers integrate over either the UV-A or UV-B band or both, which encompasses the entire UV region of daylight. The names broadband and narrowband refer to the width of the ‘window’ or range of wavelengths to which a sensor responds. The term full-width half-maximum (FWHM) is used to measure this, it means the width of the peak in units of wavelength, measured at half the maximum height of the peak along the y-axis (with the output of the sensor on the y-axis plotted on a linear scale). A narrow band-pass can have a 10 nm or 20 nm FWHM while a wide one can have an 80 nm FWHM for instruments measuring a combination of UV-A and UV-B radiation.\nTheir low cost, fast response (typically milliseconds to seconds), stability and low maintenance requirements make them suitable for continuous monitoring applications. The most common spectral response is one that follows the erythemal action spectrum defined by the Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage, or CIE, (McKinlay and Diffey 1987; A. R. Webb et al. 2011), which describes the response of the human skin to UV radiation (Figure [fig:action:spectra], on page ).\nHowever, erythemally effective can be derived from most UV measuring instruments if the radiation spectrum is known and fairly stable in time such as when measuring sunlight. Hence, in meteorology the UV index is taken as a common factor that should be obtained from the data at every measuring site. Vice versa, using a correction factor to the instrument’s output, actual erythemal irradiance in effective can be calculated. Data from UV broadband instruments are part of a worldwide UV database that is located in the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC) as a part the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) programme of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).\nAs the spectral response of broadband radiometers only approximately follow the needed for the desired response, their use for measuring different radiation sources requires source-specific calibration. The readings of broadband radiometers calibrated for sunlight should not be used to assess doses from lamps without using correction factors obtained by calibration. For measuring lamps and LEDs the use of a spectroradiometer is strongly recommended.\n\n6.10.1 Principle of operation\nThe basic design of broadband instruments has not changed significantly since the introduction of the first erythemally weighted solar radiometer, the Robertson-Berger meter (Robertson 1972; Berger 1976). When direct and scattered solar radiation is transmitted through the transmitting quartz dome, the most common way to obtain an erythemal weighting is to filter out nearly all visible light using -transmitting black-glass blocking filters. The remaining radiation then strikes a sensitive fluorescent phosphor to convert UV-B light to visible light, i.e. green light emitted by the phosphor. This light is filtered again using coloured glass to remove any non-green visible light before impinging on a gallium arsenic or a gallium arsenic phosphorus photodiode used as detector.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nA thermally stable amplifier converts the diode’s output current to a voltage. It drives a line amplifier that provides a low impedance 0 to +4 V DC output signal. Phosphor efficiency decreases by approximately 0.5% K^{-1} and its wavelength response curve is shifted by approximately 1 nm towards the red every 10 K. This latter effect is particularly important because of the slope of the solar radiation curve at these wavelengths. The glass filters, phosphor and photodiode are held at 25 to 50, depending on the manufacturer, to ensure that the output signal is not sensitive to changes in ambient temperature. Temperature stabilization is usually achieved by an internal thermistor that permits independent monitoring of the sensor’s temperature (Figure [fig:Yankee]). The analogue electrical signal produced by the broadband UV instrument is converted into digital format for electronic logging. The sampling frequency is usually between once per second (1 Hz) and once per minute. If the complete data set is not stored then data are saved as averages over periods ranging from 10 minutes to not more than one hour. Sometimes, the variation around the mean is also recorded for each averaging period. This indicates the constancy of the conditions during the averaging period (e.g. sun screening by rapidly changing cloud cover: broken clouds or clear sky or constant cloudiness). The raw signal must be converted into units of erythemal irradiance () using a calibration factor, plus several corrections. These corrections require additional data: solar zenith angle () and ozone column depth at the time of measurement.\nErythemal effective irradiance () is calculated (A. Webb, Gröbner, and Blumthaler 2006): {E_{\\mathrm{CIE}}} = ({U_{\\mathrm{}}}- {U_{\\mathrm{d}}}) \\cdot k \\cdot f({\\theta}, {\\omega}) \\cdot f({T_{\\mathrm{}}}) \\cdot {\\varphi} Where: {U_{\\mathrm{}}} is the measured electrical signal from the radiometer, {U_{\\mathrm{d}}} is the electrical offset for dark conditions, k is the calibration coefficient, a constant value determined for specific conditions, e.g. at of 40and a total ozone column of 300 DU[^20]. f({\\theta}, {\\omega}) is a function of the solar zenith angle () and the total column of ozone (), i.e. the function can be expressed as a calibration matrix (or look up table) and is derived as part of the calibration procedure. It is normalized at a solar zenith angle of 40and a total ozone column of 300 DU. For solar zenith angles less than 40, f({\\theta}, {\\omega}) is often nearly unity. f({T_{\\mathrm{}}}) is the temperature correction function. It is recommended that the instrument is temperature stabilized. If this is not applicable then a correction should be applied, which is complex and not always successful. {\\varphi} is the cosine correction function (if necessary, otherwise =1).\nThe quality of the broadband instrument depends on the quality of the protective quartz dome, the cosine response, the temperature stability, and the ability of the manufacturer to match the erythemal curve with a combination of glass and diode characteristics. Instrument temperature stability is crucial, with respect to both the electronics and the response of the phosphor to the incident UV radiation.\nMore recently, broadband instruments are using thin film metal interference filter technology and specially developed silicon photodiodes to measure UV erythemal irradiance. This overcomes many problems connected with the phosphor technology, but on the other hand they have difficulties related to very low photodiode signal levels and filter stability. Silicon carbide () photodiodes have good sensitivity to radiation and are intrinsically blind to visible radiation.\nOther broadband instruments use one of these measurement technologies to measure other regions of the spectrum by using either a combination of glass filters or interference filters. Some manufacturers of these instruments provide simple algorithms to approximate erythemal dosage from the unweighted measurements (WMO 2008).\nThe maintenance of broadband instruments consists of ensuring that the domes are cleaned, the instrument is level, the desiccant (if provided) is active, and the heating/cooling system is working correctly, if so equipped.\n\n\n6.10.2 Some commonly used terrestrial instruments\nThe most common outdoor broadband radiometers are: SL 501 from Solar Light, Inc. (Glenside, PA, USA), YES UVB-1 from Yankee Environmental Systems, Inc. (Turners Falls, MA, USA), UVS-E-T (erythemal), UVS-A-T (UV-A) and UVS-B-T (UV-B) from Kipp & Zonen (Delft, The Netherlands) (Figure [fig:UV:pyranometers]). The principle of operation of these meters is basically the same as described in section 9.5.1. Unlike the other meters, the Scintec UV-S-290-T uses a Teflon diffuser under the quartz dome in front of the filters. These three instruments are temperature stabilized by means of heating elements and temperature sensors. Solar light also sells non-stabilized instruments like the PMA2101 (digital) and PMA1101 (analog), which contain a temperature sensor whose output can be used to correct in silico for the temperature dependency of the UV-B readings.\n\n  \n\nBroadband sensors based on special silicon photodiodes are also available, which, are more stable with respect to variation in temperature than those based on phosphors. Delta-Ohm (Padova, Italy), Delta-T Devices (Cambridge, UK) and Sky instruments (Llandrindod Wells, UK) make sensors based on this principle. Examples are the SKU 420, SKU 430, and SKU 440 (UV-A, UV-B, and erythemal, respectively) from Sky Instruments, LP UVA 01/03 and LP UVB 01/03 from Delta-Ohm, and UV3pB-05 and UV3pA-05 from Delta-T devices (Figure [fig:UV:diode:sensors]). All of them are UV radiometers with no temperature stabilization or in-built temperature sensors. International Light Technologies (Peabody, USA) makes a wide array of meters and sensors for measuring radiation. Vital Technologies used to make good UV sensors which were popular some years ago, but the company is no longer in business. Most of these sensors have built-in preamplifiers.\n\n \n\n\n\n6.10.3 Spectral and angular (cosine) response\nRadiation incident on a flat horizontal surface originating from a point source with a defined zenith position will have an intensity value proportional to the cosine of the zenith angle of incidence. This is called the ‘cosine law’ or ‘cosine-response’ (see section 9.1.2 on page ). Ideally, a pyranometer has a directional response, which is the same as the cosine-law. Nevertheless, directional response in a pyranometer is influenced by the quality, dimensions and construction of the (quartz) dome and/or Teflon diffuser. Pyranometer cosine-response is defined in their manufacturers specification as deviation from the ideal cosine-response using the incidence angle up to 80with respect to 1000 irradiance at normal incidence (0). Most sensors deviate considerably from ideal cosine response at angles between 80and 90.\nThe erythemal response of human skin to UV radiation varies with the individual, but for the global evaluation of UV-related health effects to succeed, broadband measurements have to be standardized, which means that the radiometric characteristics of all meters should be identical. The spectral response of every meter should follow exactly the same reference action spectrum and the angular response should not deviate from the cosine response (Leszczynski 2002). Hence, the spectral response of an ideal erythemally weighted radiometer should follow the CIE curve, and the angular response should follow the cosine function. Unfortunately, the angular and spectral response of real erythema meters are far from ideal; moreover, the characteristics vary from one meter unit to another, even within the same meter type (Leszczynski 2002).\nBroadband radiometers that do not follow the CIE erythemal action spectrum as are also used. For some radiometers the spectral response follows a bell-shaped curve centred on the UV-A or UV-B bands (see Figure [fig:UV:sensors:spectra]). Radiometers following the GEN or other spectra commonly used as BSWFs in research with plants, are very seldom used, and they are currently not available commercially. However, almost any UV-B radiometer can be calibrated to measure according to these BSWFs, but such calibrations are valid only when the calibration light source exactly matches the spectrum of the measured light source.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n6.10.4 Calibration and intercomparison\nEach broadband instrument used to measure solar or lamp radiation should be characterized for its spectral and angular response, and its sensitivity to temperature (and if possible humidity). These characteristics should be checked at regular intervals to determine their stability. Also, correction is necessary for each instrument, as no instrument has a spectral sensitivity identical to the erythemal action spectrum.\nTo calibrate a broadband instrument for solar radiation, the basic procedure is to simultaneously measure the spectral irradiance of the sun with a calibrated spectroradiometer and the broadband meter under cloudless sky conditions. The measured spectrum is weighted with the desired spectral sensitivity[^21] of the broadband meter and integrated over all wavelengths relevant for the broadband meter. The result is given in the units [detector-weighted ], relative to a defined wavelength, usually the maximum of the erythemal action spectrum (CIE) at 298 nm or the maximum of the spectral sensitivity of the broadband meter. For different atmospheric conditions, such as different solar elevation or different thickness of the ozone column, the relationship between the detector-weighted spectral integral, measured with a spectroradiometer, and the output of the broadband detector, after cosine correction, should be constant within the uncertainty estimate; if this is not the case, the mismatch indicates that the spectral sensitivity of the broadband meter deviates from the that used to calculate effective irradiances from the spectral irradiance data (e.g. that defined by the CIE standard for erythema), or that the spectroradiometric measurements were incorrectly done (Seckmeyer et al. 2005).\nWhen measuring the output from lamps using broadband sensors calibrated under sunlight, large errors are incurred. In the example shown in Table [tab:broadband:cal:errors], we use Kipp sensors because this manufacturer has published instrument spectral response data plotted on a logarithmic scale. Errors of a similar magnitude should be expected for equivalent sensors from other manufacturers. When measuring the irradiance from lamps under a background of sunlight as in some modulated systems, or when the spectrum changes as occurs when profiling the radiation change with depth in water bodies, other types of instruments like multiband sensors or spectroradiometers are preferable.\n\n\n6.10.5 UV radiation monitoring in growth chambers, greenhouses and phytotrons\nErythemal broadband instruments are widely used to monitor UV radiation levels in growth chambers. Great care must be taken when using such instruments for this purpose since plant action spectra generally deviate from the CIE function. In addition, the reflectance of walls and other surfaces of growth chambers may affect the readings if the cosine response is not good. Great care is needed when artificial light sources are used, because their spectra differ greatly from the solar spectrum for which broadband instruments are normally calibrated. Correction factors for the solar zenith angle and ozone dependence of the calibration factors are based on unfiltered solar spectra, so cannot be applied to measurements performed in such chambers, hence special treatment of data may be necessary. In most cases if absolute readings are needed, the broadband sensor should be calibrated against a double-monochromator spectroradiometer, for each different light source to be measured. Failing to do so can cause huge errors in the measurements of doses as shown in Table [tab:broadband:cal:errors].",

    "text": "6.11 Multi-channel filter instruments\nMultichannel instruments are radiometers that measure a series of fixed, usually narrow, wavelength bands of radiation. They are more rugged and cheaper than high quality spectroradiometers and easier to deploy. Each channel has its own detector (e.g. silicon photodiode) and filter (e.g. interference filters). Usually there is a single diffuser acting as common light collector for all channels. One example of a multichannel instrument is the GUV-2511 from Biospherical Instruments Inc (San Diego, USA) designed to measure cosine-corrected downwelling irradiance at 305, 313, 320, 340, 380, and 395 nm, as well as PAR (400–700 nm). When measuring daylight this allows to monitor UV radiation in key UV wavebands for biological exposure studies. These wavelengths also allow the extraction of cloud optical thickness and total column ozone, two critical variables used in modelling the solar spectrum. Multichannel sensors are mainly used for long-term monitoring of irradiance and its geographic variation. They are also used for ground measurements used to calibrate space-borne instruments carried by satellites.\nRecent multichannel instruments from Biospherical Instruments are modular. They are composed of microradiometers of small size, one for each channel, which together with input optics and filters are used to build the multichannel instruments.

It uses an integrating sphere to collect the light, which reaches the detectors after bouncing on the sphere walls. The autonomous version includes a built-in datalogger. It is waterproof, but it is not submersible. The underwater version is described in section 9.8.3 on page .\n\n\n\nimage",

    "text": "6.12 Underwater sensors and profiling\n\n6.12.1 Measuring underwater UV radiation\nMeasuring UV radiation in the aquatic environment is difficult. Waterproof UV-measuring devices are needed or sensors protected in water proof housings as well as a means of deploying the sensors at the desired depth. Frequently, underwater measurements are referenced to the (spectral) irradiance at the surface of the water body, measured simultaneously with a matched “atmospheric” or terrestrial sensor.\nAs was mentioned in section 7.6 on page , measurement of the underwater UV field presents particular complexities, mainly related to variable attenuation occurring in different water bodies (J. T. O. Kirk 1994). Depending on the physical and chemical characteristics of the water, irradiance may decrease much more rapidly than irradiance (this phenomenon is known as ‘spectral leakage’), resulting in a changing spectrum with depth. Thus, underwater UV instruments are normally equipped with different filters and photodiodes to minimize these effects and to improve the sensitivity to particular wavelengths of interest. As discussed above in section 9.5.4 on page , errors are introduced if the spectrum being measured differs from that of the source used for calibration of the broadband instrument. This implies that when using broadband sensors underwater the errors will depend on the depth at which the radiation is being measured. In addition, a general problem exists for broadband sensors and spectrometers if sensors are only calibrated in air. The same calibration function cannot be used with the sensor in air and in water. Wavelength-dependent correction factors, so called immersion factors, must be used to adjust the signal if sensors are immersed in water as for example described by (Ohde and Siegel 2003).\nWater movement and weather conditions can affect the measurements of underwater UV radiation. For an accurate determination of UV radiation in the field, sunny, cloudless conditions and calm waters are preferred. The effect of waves may cause difficulties especially when measuring near the surface. On the other hand, clouds and other atmospheric UV absorbing phenomena can alter the conditions during the measurement of vertical light profiles, especially when the diffuse component of the beam is altered.\nSolar zenith angle is an important factor which affects the irradiance above the water surface, and also the reflectance of the water surface for the wavelengths of biological relevance. In addition, the RAF (RAF, see also section [sec:RAF]), can be used to estimate the effect of changes in the ozone column on biologically effective exposure. Corrections can be applied to measurements performed with broadband instruments, but measurements with narrow-band multi-filter instruments and spectroradiometers are less error prone.\nIf our objective is to describe the characteristics of the waters, radiation should be measured around solar noon, when solar elevation is maximal. However, if we are interested in describing the daily exposure of some organism, measurements should be done preferably during most of the day and at the depths of interest.\n\n\n6.12.2 Profiling\nProfiling is the measurement of irradiance or spectral irradiance as a function of depth in a water body. Special frames are used for lowering the instruments through the water. For light measuring instruments, the frame or rig should not occlude the field of view of the radiation sensors. A means of determining the depth at which the sensor is located, and any deviation from a vertical orientation should also be available. Suitable cabling is used to connect the underwater sensors to onboard computers or dataloggers.\n\n\n6.12.3 Underwater radiometers\nVarious underwater radiometers are currently available and their accuracy and characteristics vary considerably. The most appropriate instrument to choose depends on the specific goals of a study. Different types of radiometers include broadband radiometers, narrow-band multifilter radiometers, photodiode array spectroradiometers, and scanning spectroradiometers, including single monochromator spectroradiometers. Comparisons of the main characteristics of different types of instruments have been published (J. T. O. Kirk 1994; Díaz, Morrow, and Booth 2000; Kjeldstad et al. 2003; Tedetti and Sempére 2006). Some commonly-used underwater instruments are described below.\nThe ELDONET radiometers (Real Time Computer, Germany) were developed within the framework of the European light dosimeter network (Figure [fig:Eldonet]) and have been described in detail (Häder et al. 1999). The dosimeters are three-channel broadband filter devices with an entrance optic consisting of an integrating Ulbricht sphere with an internal BaSO_4 coating (Khanh and Dähn 1988). Silicon photodiodes (BPX60 for the PAR range and SFH291 for the two UV wavebands, both from Siemens, Germany) are used in combination with custom-made filters to select the wavelength ranges for UV-B (280–315 nm), UV-A (315–400 nm) and PAR (400–700 nm), a custom-made interference filter for UV-B (Janos Technology, Townshend, VT, USA), a DUG 11 band filter for UV-A (Schott & Gen., Mainz, Germany) and a broad band filter for PAR (WBHM, Optical Coating Laboratory, Santa Rosa, CA, USA). Eldonet performs 60 measurements each minute.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nSubmergible multichannel radiometers like PUV 500, PUV 2500 series from Biospherical Instruments (San Diego, USA) are equipped with narrow-band filter detectors in the range of UV and PAR (Figure [fig:PUV]). These radiometers are equipped with depth and temperature sensors and thus are well suited for accurate light profiling. The spectral characteristics of the five filters used in the PUV 500 instrument are as follows: 305\\pm1 nm (band pass 7\\pm1 nm) 320\\pm2 nm (band pass 11\\pm1 nm) 340\\pm2 nm (band pass 10\\pm1 nm) 380\\pm2 nm (band pass 10\\pm1 nm)\nOn the other hand, the PUV 2500 measures 7 (optionally 8) wavebands of downwelling irradiance (305, 313, 320, 340, 380, 395 nm and PAR: 400–700 nm) with one upwelling radiance channel (natural fluorescence). Each channel with 10 nm FWHHM except 305 (controlled by atmospheric ozone cutoff). The instrument includes pressure/depth sensing (350 m maximum) and temperature control. A 32 channel multiplexer selects signals from 8 photodetectors, temperature, pressure and tilt/yaw detector. The cosine collector is made of Teflon-covered quartz for use in the water.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nThe RAMSES family of hyperspectral radiometers (Trios GmbH, Germany) are miniature single monochromator spectrometers with a resolution of 2 to 3 nm per pixel and 100 or 190 usable channels in the photodiode array (Figure [fig:RAMSES]). They can be used in air or in water. The Ramses ACC-UV is an integrated UV hyperspectral radiometer, and the Ramses ACC-VIS is a and visible hyperspectral radiometer, both equipped with a cosine collector. Ramses ASC-VIS is equipped with a spherical collector shielded so as to measure radiation from one hemisphere. To measure scalar irradiance, two of these sensors can be deployed pointing in opposite directions. They are calibrated for underwater and air measurements (two different calibrations). The device has a small size, the signal capture requires some power consumption and portable (laptop) terminal at the surface. The detector type is a silicon photodiode array designed to capture wavelengths between 320–950 nm for VIS models and 280–500 nm for the UV models, with an irradiance accuracy better than 6–10% depending on the spectral range.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nAlthough the LI-1800UW instrument is not currently produced by LI-COR, many foundational studies focused on UV penetration during the 1980s and 1990s were carried out using this spectroradiometer. The optics of this scanning spectroradiometer is based on a single holographic monochromator grating, a silicon detector and a filter wheel to improve stray light rejection. The wavelength range is between 300 and 850 nm, with a bandwidth of 8 nm and accuracy of \\pm1.5 nm. Originally optional slits of different widths were available, so these specifications vary with the exact configuration used. The whole optical bench and the microcomputer system is contained in the massive waterproof housing designed for measurements to a depth close to 200 m. Being a single monochromator instruments its accuracy is limited by stray light when used to measure -B radiation in daylight.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nThe OL 754-O-PMT Spectrometer Optics Head (Optronic Laboratories) is based on a double monochromator for low stray light and measuring from 300 to 850 nm. Configurations with other gratings giving different wavelength ranges are available. The system utilizes holographic gratings with peak efficiencies at 300 nm. The instrument can be fitted with an OL IS-470-WP Submersible Sphere Assembly (4-inch integrating sphere) attached by means of quartz optical fibre to the non-submersible spectroradiometer. The sphere follows a dual port design with an entrance port and an exit port located 90^\\circ apart. The sphere contains an internal baffle in front of the exit port to permit only light reflected by internal surface of the sphere to exit the sphere and enter the fibre.\nAnother approach to measuring underwater radiation is to protect a regular sensor, as for example, those described in section 9.5.2 on page , within a hermetic water-proof housing (Figure [fig:sensor:in:box]). Of course the enclosure should have an transparent window, and the sensors must be calibrated inside the enclosure.",

    "text": "6.13 Modelling\nFor locations and times not covered by measurements, alternative approaches have to be considered for estimating the prevailing radiation conditions. For this purpose, various methods for modelling the surface UV radiation have been developed. These range from simple theoretical-empirical methods for estimating the clear-sky surface radiation to more sophisticated methods that account also for the effects of clouds as inferred either from ground-based station data or satellite measurements. Table [tab:modelling:methods] gives a simplified view of the main features of methods that are available for modelling the surface UV radiation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple theoretical-empirical methods, such as those of L. O. Björn and Murphy (1985) and Bird and Riordan (1986), have been widely used thanks to their fairly simple user interface. These methods provide spectral surface irradiances, optionally on tilted surfaces, and account for the main parameters affecting the surface radiation conditions under cloudless skies. Results indicate that they predict the surface radiation with reasonable accuracy as compared to more detailed radiative transfer calculations and measurements (Bird and Riordan 1986).\nAnother user-friendly alternative is to use an interactive web-based interface to radiative transfer simulations, such as the FastRT (Engelsen and Kylling 2005 available at http://nadir.nilu.no/~olaeng/fastrt/fastrt.html) or the QUICK TUV (http://cprm.acd.ucar.edu/Models/TUV/Interactive_TUV/). Both of these are based on rigourous radiative transfer models, which means that their accuracy depends mainly on the choice of values for the input parameters. Both include a selection of biological weighting functions, and FastRT also provides the possibility to account for the effect of clouds.\nWhen cloud effects need to be accounted for in detail, either satellite methods or so-called reconstruction methods should be considered. The reconstruction methods usually rely on ground-based measurements of some kind for accounting for the effect of clouds on radiation. Although the methods vary in their exact approach, the idea of all of them is to utilize available observations to account for the parameters that affect the amount of UV radiation reaching the surface. These parameters are, most importantly, clouds, total ozone column, surface albedo, atmospheric aerosols, and altitude or pressure. In addition, the solar zenith angle determines the path length of the direct:rad through the atmosphere and is therefore the single most important factor for the surface UV radiation. The Earth-Sun distance, which varies over the course of the year, also needs to be accounted for.\nMany station-based methods for reconstructing the surface radiation were included in recent European efforts to gain a better understanding of past radiation and its climatological behaviour (Koepke et al. 2006; den Outer et al. 2010). Similar methods have been proposed and applied in other parts of the world as well (V. I. Fioletov et al. 2001; V. E. Fioletov et al. 2004). Compared to satellite methods, the advantage of the station-based methods is that they tend to give more accurate estimates of the surface UV radiation. In particular, methods using (300–3000 nm), measured by pyranometers at numerous stations worldwide, as input for determining the cloud effect typically show small bias and fairly small scatter when compared to measurements (Koepke et al. 2006). To mention one example, Anders Lindfors et al. (2007) estimated daily erythemal UV doses at four Nordic stations, and found a systematic difference of between 0 and 4%, depending on the station, and a root-mean-square error of 5–9% as compared to measurements for the summer period.\nSatellite methods are based on radiative transfer simulations combined with information on, for example, clouds and total ozone column retrieved from the satellite observations. Satellite retrieved UV irradiances typically show an overestimation of 10% or more, and a large scatter, when compared to surface measurements: the root-mean-square errors for daily erythemal UV doses tends to be of the order of 30–40% (Kujanpää, Kalakoski, and Koskela 2010; Tanskanen et al. 2007; A. Lindfors et al. 2009). The main part of the overestimation is usually attributed to aerosol absorption, which is not accounted for properly in current satellite UV algorithms. The advantage of satellite methods, on the other hand, is their large geographical coverage, often global, and easy access to data that they provide.\nMost methods, both station-based UV reconstruction methods and satellite methods, only provide UV data corresponding to a selection of weighting functions (e.g., erythemally weighted ), and, in addition, sometimes irradiances for selected wavelengths. Furthermore, the methods typically include only irradiances for a horizontal surface. This may become an obstacle for biological applications where, for example, a specific weighting function or spectral information would be preferred. In principle, however, many of the methods could be extended to produce spectral irradiances and fluence rates. On the other hand, fluence rates can also be estimated based on the horizontal irradiance (e.g., Kylling et al. 2003).\nRecently, Anders Lindfors et al. (2009) presented a method for modelling spectral surface irradiances. The method relies on radiative transfer simulations, and takes as input (1) the effective cloud optical depth as inferred from pyranometer measurements of global:rad; (2) the total ozone column; (3) the surface albedo as estimated from measurements of snow depth; (4) the total water vapour column; and (5) the altitude of the location. Figure [fig:jok2001] shows a comparison between the daily accumulated irradiances at 300 and 320 nm from this method and measurements with a Brewer spectroradiometer at Jokioinen, southern Finland. At both wavelengths, the reconstructed irradiances closely follow the measured ones.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nA variety of methods for modelling the surface UV radiation are available. Which method is the best, or the most appropraite, depends on the specific question that is to be answered. In general, the complexity of the method tends to grow with increasing accuracy, and the pyranometer-based UV reconstruction methods, that are considered to provide highest accuracy, typically require an expert user. The use of such a method will, however, increase cross-disciplinary collaboration and may therefore be worthwhile.\n\n By ‘biologically effective irradiance’ we mean the irradiance weighted according to the effectiveness of different wavelengths in eliciting a photobiological response. The most frequently used biologically effective irradiance quantities are photometric quantities such as those described in Box [box:photometric:quantities] on page . In the case of photometric quantities the (energy) irradiance is weighted according to the response of the human eye.\nWhen studying the effects of radiation on plants we use as BSWFs (BSWFs) spectra describing the response of some plant function. For example an action spectrum for accumulation of flavonoids, or an action spectrum for growth inhibition. To be able to calculate biologically effective irradiances using any BSWF, we need to measure the spectral irradiance of the light source.\nIf we integrate the effective irradiance for the duration of an experiment then we obtain a biologically effective exposure (usually called ‘biologically effective dose’ by biologists). If we do the time integration for one day we obtain a biologically effective daily exposure.\nThese weighted irradiances are usually expressed using units corresponding to the underlying energy irradiances, independently of the BSWF used. Quantities calculated using different BSWFs are expressed in the same units, but the values cannot be compared because in reality they are measured on different scales.",

    "text": "6.14 BSWFs and effective UV doses\nThe emission spectrum of UV-B lamps, even filtered with acetate, is different to that of the effect of ozone depletion. The spectrum of the effect of ozone depletion not only changes with ozone column thickness, but also with solar elevation. In other words, it changes through a day and with seasons (Figure [fig:lamp:solar:spectra]). Because of this, it is almost impossible to exactly simulate the effect of ozone depletion in field experiments. The best we can do is to calculate effective doses.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nBiologically effective exposures (see Box [ex:effective:irradiance]) are a way of measuring radiation differing in spectral composition with the same ‘measuring stick’. This ‘measuring stick’ is a biological response. Behind each measurement we need to assume the involvement of a biological response. If we know the action spectrum for the biological response, we can use it as a BSWF: We multiply, wavelength by wavelength the spectral irradiance of the light source by the BSWF obtaining a weighted spectrum, giving a biologically-effective spectral irradiance (Figure [fig:eff:spectral:irrad]). We then integrate the result over wavelengths, to obtain a single number, the biologically effective UV irradiance[^26]. In Figure [fig:eff:spectral:irrad] it also possible to appreciate the difference in relative change of this effective irradiance, for a given level of ozone depletion, depending on the BSWF used.\nIt is important to make sure that both the irradiance and the effectiveness are measured using compatible units. It is common to express action spectra as spectral quantum effectiveness and to measure light sources as spectral (energy) irradiance. In research, biologically effective doses are most frequently expressed in weighted energy units and to be able to calculate these doses from spectral (energy) irradiance measurements for a light source (sunlight or lamps) one needs to use an action spectrum expressed in energy effectiveness. Most common formulations of action spectra need to be transformed from quantum effectiveness to energy effectiveness (one important exception is the CIE erythemal spectrum formulation). This is something that is often neglected, and is a source of difficulties when comparing doses between different publications.\nAnother possibility for measuring effective doses is to have a broadband sensor with a spectral response resembling the action spectrum of interest. In practice the spectral response of such sensors is only an approximation to the desired and consequently need to be calibrated under the light source to be measured, usually by comparison to a double monochromator scanning spectroradiometer (see section 9.7 on page ). Most such sensors are calibrated for sunlight, and consequently give biased readings when used for measuring radiation from most lamps.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nThe RAF () gives the percent change in effective dose () or, strictly speaking, effective exposure () for each percent change in ozone column thickness. It should be calculated using logarithms. \\mathrm{RAF} = \\frac{\\ln {H^{\\mathrm{d}}} - \\ln {H^{\\mathrm{n}}}}%\n        {\\ln [{\\mathrm{O_3}}]^\\mathrm{n} - \\ln [{\\mathrm{O_3}}]^\\mathrm{d}} where is dose and [{\\mathrm{O_3}}] ozone concentration, and superscript \\mathrm{d} indicates ozone depleted condition, and superscript \\mathrm{n} indicates normal, or reference, ozone depth condition. The value of depends strongly on the action spectrum used to calculate the effective dose. Looking at fig. [fig:eff:spectral:irrad], it can be understood why is much larger for GEN than for PG.\n\n6.14.1 Weighting scales\nUltraviolet action spectra are usually normalized to quantum effectiveness = 1 at 300 nm. This is arbitrary, and especially in the older literature, you will find action spectra normalized at other wavelengths. In the Materials and Methods section always report the normalization used, in addition to the action spectrum used as a BSWF. Remember that as the wavelength used for normalization is arbitrary, values of effective UV doses calculated using the same BSWF but normalized at different wavelengths cannot be directly compared because they are expressed on different scales. Of course biologically effective irradiances based on different BSWFs cannot be compared to each other either.\nUsing the correct BSWF is very important, as using the wrong BSWF has usually serious implications on the interpretation of experimental results (Martyn M. Caldwell and Flint 2006; Kotilainen et al. 2011).\n\n\n6.14.2 Comparing lamps and solar radiation\nFrequently we want to compare UV doses in growth chambers to doses outdoors. Unless we have a solar simulator the spectra will differ significantly. It is especially important to keep the ratio similar to that in solar radiation. Table [tab:UVeff] gives an example comparing a frame with two acetate-filtered Q-Panel UVB-313 lamps to sunlight with normal and 20% depleted ozone at Jokioinen for 21 May at 11:30.\n\n\n6.14.3 Effective doses, enhancement errors and UV-B supplementation\nUltraviolet-radiation supplementation can be modulated so as to follow natural variation in solar UV or just follow a daily square wave pattern (see section 8.2.6 on page ). It is important that lamps are filtered with cellulose di-acetate film (to remove UV-C radiation emitted by UV-B lamps, which is absent in natural sunlight) and that these filters are replaced regularly, specially in the case of square wave systems, as modulated systems with feedback compensate for the reduced dose automatically (although not for the change in spectrum) (Newsham et al. 1996). Even when adequately filtered the emission spectrum of UV-B lamps does not match the effect of depletion (Figure [fig:weighted:lamp:depl:GPAS:PG]. We need to calculate effective doses using BSWFs.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nErrors caused by the mismatch between the doses aimed at and those achieved when simulating the effect of ozone depletion with UV-B enhancement with lamps are called enhancement errors. The main source of these errors is the mismatch between the assumed spectral response and the real spectral response. This is so because the adjustment of the burning time (or power) of the UV-B lamps used for enhancement needs to be based on biologically effective doses. However, depending on the different BSWFs used, the needed lamp burning time may be long or short (Figure [fig:lamp:burning:times]). Another way of looking at this problem is to compare the deviation of the achieved when using a ‘wrong’[^27] BSWF compared to the target one—e.g. corresponding to a certain magnitude of ozone depletion. Figure [fig:achieved:CIE] shows this comparison for the frequent case of use of a CIE-weighted broadband sensor to control the lamps used in experiments with plants. The errors are surprisingly small for GEN and PG.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nAn additional source of errors is shading by the lamp frames. If we do not attempt to compensate for the shade with UV-B from the lamps the error between PG and GEN is small (Kotilainen et al. 2011). How much the effective UV dose decreases with shading does not depend on the BSWF used as long as the shade is ‘gray’ (equally affects all relevant wavelengths). However, how much UV from the lamps will be needed to compensate for this will depend on the BSWF used (Table [tab:shading:errors]). With some BSWFs the lamp power or burning time needed to compensate for shading is much more than that needed to simulate ozone depletion, because with spectra like PG, we need to replace shaded UV-A with UV-B from lamps. See section [sec:RAF] on page for a discussion of the relationship between changes in ozone column and changes in effective UV radiation.\nTo minimize shading errors we must build lamp frames that produce little shade. Probably &lt;\\!5% shading is achievable. We should not attempt to compensate for shading by the frames with UV from lamps. Shifting the whole experiment’s UV baseline dose by a small percentage but keeping the size of enhancement at the target level is probably the best approach available.",

    "text": "6.15 Effective UV doses outdoors: seasonal and latitudinal variation\nThe state of the atmosphere (in terms of ozone column thickness, cloudiness and aerosol content) together with day-length and daily course of the solar zenith angle () are the main factors determining the climatology of (and its components, and ) at ground level. For clear sky conditions the average spatial and temporal distribution of UV irradiance can be computed by means of a radiative transfer model fed with proper and aerosol data (Grifoni et al. 2008, 2009). In these conditions the latitudinal and temporal distribution of irradiance are driven mainly by two factors: day-length and through the day. See section 9.9 on page for a discussion of different approaches to modelling.\nTo go from the climatology of spectral irradiance to that of the biologically effective () exposures (or doses), spectral irradiance has to be weighted to account for the different efficiency of each wavelength in producing biological effects; this is done applying a BSWF—based on the action spectrum of the biological process considered. Plant action spectra differ in the weight given to and radiation, as it has been illustrated in section 7.8 on page . In this analysis Grifoni et al. (2009) considered two action spectra related to plant response: the so-called Generalized Plant Action spectrum (GEN, proposed by M. M. Caldwell 1971) and the more recent Plant Growth spectrum (PG, S. D. Flint and Caldwell 2003). The erythemal action spectrum (CIE, McKinlay and Diffey 1987) was also included since instruments with a spectral sensibility quite close to it have been used in several field experiments. The analysis presented in this section was based on spectral global irradiance for cloud-free conditions on horizontal surfaces simulated by means of the STAR model (Ruggaber, Dlugi, and Nakajima 1994; Schwander et al. 2000) for Rome, Italy (lat. 41.88 N, long. 12.47 E), Potsdam, Germany (lat. 52.40 N, long. 13.03 E) and Trondheim, Norway (lat. 63.42 N, long. 10.42 E) on the first day of each month of the year from 1:00 to 23:00 (UTC time) with a 30 min time step. Daily doses () were calculated for all these 12 days.\nAfter convoluting the spectral energy irradiances at ground level for the three locations and seasons with the three BSWFs, a picture of the seasonal of radiation was obtained, which was different depending on latitude. The pattern of seasonal and latitudinal variation of the daily doses is shown to depend strongly on the BSWF, and day of the year (Table [tab:doses:seasons]).\nThe changes in daily doses occurring through the year relative to the yearly average, for the three locations across Europe illustrate the effect of action spectra used as BSWFs (Figure [fig:doses:seasonal]).\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nThe largest seasonal variation occurs when the daily doses are computed on the basis of action spectra completely or partially excluding the contribution of the component, as in the case of GEN and CIE respectively. Figure [fig:doses:seasonal] shows the extent to which latitude affects these seasonal changes, which have a larger amplitude as the latitude increases. In other words, the climatology of appears to be strongly dependent on the action spectrum used, and, as different plant responses follow different action spectra, the effective climatology will depend on the plant response under study.\nThese differences in climatology are ecologically relevant, for instance for perennial species that may experience different seasonal change in the irradiance they are exposed to, depending on the latitude at which they are growing and on the biological process/action spectrum studied.",

    "text": "6.17 An accuracy ranking of quantification methods\nTable [tab:methods:accuracy] shows a preliminary comparison of different methods available for quantifying solar UV radiation and estimating biologically effective doses. Bias is the systematic directional deviation from the true value, for example overestimation of irradiance or doses. Uncertainty is a random deviation that prevents us from knowing the true value, but deviations are not systematic —measurements from different instruments or the same instruments after different recalibrations will deviate by different amounts and in different directions from the true value.\nA detailed comparison is difficult with the information currently available, consequently some gaps remain in the table. However, some general recommendations are possible. For outdoors experiments with manipulation of solar , the best option is most probably a combination of (a) hourly simulation of UV spectral irradiance with a model using ground station data as input, plus (b) spot measurements, for example under different filters with a spectroradiometer under clear sky conditions. It is best to replace modelling (a) with actual continuous measurements with a well calibrated double monochromator spectroradiometer. However, this is rarely possible in practice, as there are few ground stations producing validated spectral data.\nFor experiments using lamps, the best option from the point of view of accuracy is the use of a double monochromator spectroradiometer. From a practical viewpoint, using a broadband instrument calibrated against a double monochromator spectroradiometer, may be easier. When measuring mixed daylight and lamp radiation, or mixed radiation from diverse lamps, or when there is degradation of filters, broadband instruments are totally unsuitable.\nSingle monochromator spectroradiometers should be avoided for measurements of radiation when there is a background of or visible radiation, unless very special handling of stray light is done by a combination of special measuring protocols and data processing.",

See sections 8.6.1 and 8.6.2 for recommendations on manipulation of radiation, section 10.9 for recommendations about plant growing conditions, and section 11.12 for recommendations about statistical design of experiments.\n\nAlways report in your publications the radiation effective exposure (frequently called effective doses in the biological literature), depending on the type of experiment, as daily integrated values or effective irradiances plus daily exposure time. Calculate effective doses using relevant action spectra and if possible report doses using all the most commonly used ones: CIE, GEN(G), and PG.\nAlways indicate the name of the quantity measured, the type of sensor and its position during measurement, location of sensor with reference to plants, and unit of measurement. In the case of effective doses, indicate how they were calculated, in particular, cite the bibliographic source for the action spectrum and formulation used, and at which wavelength the spectrum was normalized to effectiveness equal to unity.\nWhenever possible include in your publications the emission spectrum of the light source and/or transmittance spectrum of the filters used, or cite an earlier paper where the spectra have already been published.\nUse only instruments with recent and valid calibration data for the measurements at hand.\nMake sure, in the case of broadband sensors, that the calibration is valid for the light source being measured. For example, broadband sensors calibrated for sunlight should not be used for measuring irradiance under lamps.\nIf high precision is required in the measurements, apply all the necessary corrections. This is important both for broadband and spectral measurements.\nBe aware of temperature effects on the functioning of the meter and sensor used and apply the required corrections or use temperature stabilized instruments.\nSingle monochromator array or scanning spectrometers can be used for measuring effective exposures in sunlight only with very serious limitations and only if complicated corrections are applied to the raw data to take into account stray light and the properties of the slit function. These corrections are not possible with the software provided by the makers of the instruments. Uncorrected measurements from this type of instruments are subject to huge uncertainties and, what is worse, bias. Use double monochromator spectroradiometers instead.\nWhen using spectrometers configured with SMA connectors for optical fibres, do not detach the fibre at the spectrometer end[^28][^29]. Doing so invalidates the calibration because the alignment of the fibre with respect to the entrance slit may be different after the fibre is reattached.\nWhen measuring, take into account the field of view of the entrance optics of your instrument (e.g. one hemisphere for a cosine corrected irradiance sensor) and make sure that yourself and any other nearby objects do not disturb the radiation ‘seen’ by the instrument.\nTake into account that spot measurements of in sunlight under different filters describe only one point in time. Continuous measurements or modelling based on continuous ground-based measurements are needed to fully describe the treatments applied.\nOutdoor irradiance is affected by cloudiness, so measurements where a single instrument is moved to take sequential measurements under the different treatments should be avoided unless the sky is perfectly clear. In addition, parallel measurement of PAR or global radiation in the open is recommended so as to be able to detect any variation due to clouds.\nexposure values (also called doses) derived from satellite-based measurements are subject to relatively large errors and bias, so it is better to avoid their use, specially when daily or weekly values are needed. Much of the uncertainty derives from the sparse nature of the satellite data (e.g. one or fewer fly overs per day).\nRoutinely check your instruments. Frequently check that the readings are very close to zero when the sensor is in darkness. Do sanity checks on your data against values expected (e.g. using models or published data). For example if when measuring a sunlight spectrum you get spectral irradiance values different from zero[^30] at wavelengths shorter than 290 nm you can be sure that there is a problem. There may be too much stray light, or a bad correction for the dark signal, or simply the spectrometer is not good enough for the job.\nWhen measuring sunlight or lamp spectra for calculating effective doses you need a spectroradiometer with a spectral resolution of at least 1 nm. Furthermore to reduce noise use only averaging of repeated scans rather than ‘Boxcar smoothing’. Boxcar smoothing reduces the spectral resolution by doing a moving average across wavelengths.",

    "text": "6.21 Appendix: Formulations for action spectra used as BSWFs\nThe calculation of biologically effective UV doses requires weighting the spectral energy irradiance () or spectral photon irradiance () at each wavelength with a weighting value that is typically generated from a mathematical formulation fitted to describe the weighting function or action spectrum of the biological process—i.e. a BSWF (BSWF). Data obtained from a spectroradiometer are usually provided as spectral energy irradiance (units: ) and care should be taken to use the appropriate formulation that uses either energy effectiveness () or quantum effectiveness () values as appropriate.\nThe usual approach is to base effective UV doses on energy irradiance data, using BSWFs that provide values for relative energy effectiveness at each wavelength. However, BSWFs are often defined using quantum effectiveness for application to photon irradiance values. Consequently, conversion of energy irradiance values measured during experiments to photon irradiance is necessary before applying weighting functions originally formulated using quantum effectiveness. Conversion of energy irradiance values to photon irradiance can be achieved using equation [eq:photon] on page . After conversion, the calculated effective doses will be on a different scale than if they are calculated based on energy irradiance values. Note that you may find examples in the literature where formulations based on quantum effectiveness () have been inappropriately applied to spectral energy exposure (unit: ) or spectral energy irradiance (unit: ).\nThe general plant action spectrum of Caldwell (Code GEN in Table [tab:action:spectra] on page ) was originally published simply as a graphical figure of quantum effectiveness against wavelength (M. M. Caldwell 1971) and subsequently two publications have fitted different mathematical formulations to describe its use as a weighting function. Green, Sawada, and Shettle (1974) fitted a function that decreases to zero at 313 nm whereas an alternative mathematical fit provided by Thimijan, Carns, and Campbell (1978) continues to weight irradiance values up to 345 nm in the region. Both of these functions are shown on Figure [fig:action:spectra] on page as GEN(G) and GEN(T) respectively. It is important to specify which mathematical function has been used when describing the calculation of effective UV doses in experimental methods.\nThe general plant action spectrum of Caldwell fitted with the mathematical function of Green, Sawada, and Shettle (1974) is given by (Source: L.

Björn and Teramura 1993):\n{s_{\\mathrm{GEN(G)}}^\\mathrm{p}}(\\lambda) = \\begin{cases}\n           2.618 \\cdot \\left[ 1-\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{313.3}\\right)^2 \\right] \\cdot %\\cr\n\\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{\\lambda-300}{31.08}} & \\text{if $\\lambda\\le313.3$ nm}\\\\\n0 & \\text{if $\\lambda&gt;313.3$ nm}\n\\end{cases} \\label{eq:GEN.G}\nand when fitted with the mathematical function of Thimijan, Carns, and Campbell (1978) is given by (Source: L. O. Björn and Teramura 1993):\n{s_{\\mathrm{GEN(T)}}^\\mathrm{p}}(\\lambda) = \\begin{cases}\n\\mathrm{e}^{-\\left(\\frac{265-\\lambda}{21}\\right)^2} & \\text{if $\\lambda\\le345$ nm}\\\\\n0 & \\text{if $\\lambda&gt;345$ nm}\n\\end{cases} \\label{eq:GEN.T}\nThe DNA damage formulation of Green and Miller (1975) is given by:\n%\\qeff[DNA(GM)](\\lambda) & = & \\exp\\left\\{ 13.82 \\cdot \\left[ \\left( 1+\\exp\\left( \\frac{\\lambda-310}{9} \\right)\\right)^{-1} -1 \\right] \\right\\} \\label{eq:DNA.GM}\n{s_{\\mathrm{DNA(GM)}}^\\mathrm{p}}(\\lambda) = \\mathrm{e}^{ 13.82 \\cdot \\left[ \\left( 1+\\mathrm{e}^{ \\frac{\\lambda-310}{9}} \\right)^{-1} -1 \\right] } \\label{eq:DNA.GM}\nThe doses calculated with this formulation differ significantly from doses calculated using tabulated values derived from the figure in Setlow (1974). For example the model TUV and the data from the NSF monitoring network use the tabulated values rather than the formulation by Green and Miller (1975).\nHowever, most BSWFs are conventionally used with a value of one at 300 nm. This may be achieved by simple calculation adjustments within a spreadsheet (by dividing each wavelength effectiveness by the effectiveness value at 300 nm) or by altering the mathematical formula directly. Thus, the mathematical formulation of Green, Sawada, and Shettle (1974) for GEN(G) requires equation [eq:GEN.G] to be multiplied by 4.596 to normalize it to a value of 1 at 300nm and similarly GEN(T) requires equation [eq:GEN.T] to be multiplied by 16.083 and DNA(GM) requires equation [eq:DNA.GM] to be multiplied by 30.675.\nThe formulation of the weighting function published by S. D. Flint and Caldwell (2003) for plant growth, shown as PG in Figure [fig:action:spectra] on page , was for quantum effectiveness and already provides normalization to 1 at 300 nm and is given by:\n%\\qeff[PG](\\lambda) & = & \\cases{\\mathrm{e}^{4.688272\\ \\cdot\n% \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{e}^{0.1703411 \\cdot \\frac{\\lambda-307.867}{1.15} +\n%\\left(\\frac{390-\\lambda}{121.7557}-4.183832\\right)}}} & if $\\lambda\\le390$ nm\\cr\n%0 & if $\\lambda&gt;390$ nm\\cr} \\label{eq:PG}\n{s_{\\mathrm{PG}}^\\mathrm{p}}(\\lambda) =  \\begin{cases}\\exp\\left(4.688272\\ \\cdot \\right. \\cr\n\\left.\n\\ \\ \\ \\exp\\left(-\\exp\\left(0.1703411 \\cdot \\frac{\\lambda-307.867}{1.15}\\right)\\right) + \\right. %\\cr\n\\left.\n\\left(\\frac{390-\\lambda}{121.7557}-4.183832\\right)\\right) & \\text{if $\\lambda\\le390$ nm}\\\\\n0 & \\text{if $\\lambda&gt;390$ nm}\n\\end{cases}\n\\label{eq:PG}\nSome weighting functions are already defined using energy effectiveness values for use with energy irradiance data, one example being the CIE erythemal action spectrum (McKinlay and Diffey 1987; A. R. Webb et al. 2011). The standard was revised in 1998 and the updated version should be used instead of the original one from 1987 (A. R. Webb et al. 2011). It is important to check that published mathematical formulae have been appropriately normalized to one at 300 nm. However, whereas most BSWFs are conventionally set to one at 300 nm, the CIE98 erythemal weighting function has defined values at specific wavelengths (A. R. Webb et al. 2011) and is given by:\n{s_{\\mathrm{CIE}}}(\\lambda) = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if $250\\le\\lambda\\le298$ nm}\\\\\n10^{0.094(298-\\lambda)} & \\text{if $298\\le\\lambda\\le328$ nm}\\\\\n10^{0.015(140-\\lambda)} & \\text{if $328\\le\\lambda\\le400$ nm}\\\\\n0 & \\text{if $\\lambda &gt; 400$}\n\\end{cases} \\label{eq:CIE}\nWeighting functions defined using quantum effectiveness (), and normalized to one at 300 nm, can be converted to relative energy effectiveness () simply by multiplication, wavelength by wavelength, of the quantum effectiveness by by the respective wavelength in nm and dividing by 300 (the chosen normalization wavelength in nm). The value 300 should be changed when using other wavelengths for normalization. This is based on equation [eq:photon] giving the energy in one photon, but as Planck’s constant (h) and the speed of light in vacuum (c) are constant divisors, and we are expressing the effectiveness in relative units, they can be left out of the calculation.\nIt is always essential to specify clearly the normalization wavelength, the mathematical formulation and the BSWF used when describing the calculation of effective UV doses.\n\n2\n\n6.22 Appendix: Calculation of effective doses with Excel\nLet us start with a text file generated by a spectroradiometer and its connected computer. With the instruments that I have used this text file consists of one column, containing either spectral (energy) irradiance or spectral photon irradiance (some instruments, especially for underwater use, may have fluence rate instead of irradiance). At the start, above the columns, is a heading containing supplementary information. Other instruments may have two columns, the first one containing wavelength values, the other one spectral irradiance values.\nFor the Optronics instruments that I have used, the start of a data file looks like the listing in Figure [fig:list:Optronics]. The heading here contains “a”, which in this case is the name of the file, the kind of data that is recorded (including the unit), the date, the starting wavelength in nm, the end wavelength (not shown here) in nm, and the step interval in nm. This file can be loaded into an Excel file going to Data&gt;Get external data&gt;Load text file. When you have done this, insert a new column to the left of the one containing the measured data. In this new column you should fill in the wavelength values, which can be done in the following way without typing every value:\n\n\n\"a\",\"Irradiance [W/(cm^2 nm)]\",971217,250.00,400.00,1.00\n1.439562E-010\n1.797497E-010\n6.126532E-010\n4.516362E-009\n8.027722E-009\n1.081851E-009\n2.862175E-010\n1.728253E-010\n1.790998E-010\n1.953554E-010\n2.570309E-010\n...\n\n\nType the first two values, i.e. in this case first “250” in the cell left of the one containing the first radiation value 1.439562E-010. Since the step interval is 1.00 nm, the next value is 251. Type this in the cell to the left of the value 1.797497E-010. Select the two cells that you have just filled in. Put the cursor at the lower left corner of the cell containing “251” and see it change appearance, push the (left) mouse button and drag down to the cell left of the last radiation value. The column will then fill up with the appropriate wavelength values.\nYou have now filled columns A and B with the appropriate values. Next you should generate a column with values of the weighting function. Suppose you wish to use the weighting function of S. D. Flint and Caldwell (2003). The formula given for this in the publication is Biologically effective UV= \\exp[4.688272*\\exp(- \\exp(0.1703411*(x-307.867)/1.15))+((390-x)/121.7557-4.183832)] in which x stands for wavelength in nm.\nSelect cells in column C over the rows corresponding to values in columns A and B. Go to “Tools” on top of the file, push the mouse button and go down and select “Calculator”. Type the formula above, with the exceptions that you use ordinary parentheses instead of square brackets, “A:A” instead of “x” (do not type the quotation marks), and comma instead of dot if you use the comma system. When this is done, press OK and save the result.\nYou now have the values of the weighting function in column C. If you double-click on the first value in column C you should get the equation entered. The top of your file should then look like Figure [fig:Excel:sheet]. If you insert a new column C to the left of your old column C and copy the wavelength values into it you can plot your weighting function as a check. If you plot it on a logarithmic abscissa, it should look something like Figure [fig:Excel:PG]. This can be compared to the plot in the original publication by S. D. Flint and Caldwell (2003). Once you have generated a weighting function that you wish to use several times, you need of course not calculate it like this every time. You can simply transfer the column with it to a new sheet or a new Excel file. Since, as newly generated, it depends on another column, you need to use the command “Paste special” and choose “values”.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nNow you are ready to do the weighting itself. Select cells in column E in rows corresponding to the values in the other columns. Select the Calculator, and use it to multiply values in column B with the weighting function. Select an empty cell and go a final time to the Calculator. Select “Sum” and then the values you have just generated in column E. The sum you get in the cell you selected is the weighted radiation value. The number is, in this case, 0.000334759 and the unit is W cm^{-2}, which can also be expressed as 3.35 . The bottom of the file should look like Figure [fig:Excel:sheet:bottom]. I have written \\Sigma in one cell to remember that the value to the right of it is the sum of the values above it.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nNote that if you have another step size than 1 nm, you must multiply the sum by that step size. It is recommended that you do not use step sizes greater than 1 nm for UV-B spectra, since both the spectra themselves and the weighting functions are so steep.\nMartyn Caldwell’s traditional Generalized Plant Action Spectrum is easier to handle, and you should be able now to do a similar exercise with it yourself. A formula for this weighting function has been published by Green, Sawada, and Shettle (1974): Weighting function = 2.618\\cdot[1 -( \\lambda/313.3)2]\\cdot \\exp[-(\\lambda - 300)/31.08], where \\lambda stands for wavelength in nm. We abbreviate the name of this action spectrum as GEN(G) elsewhere in this text. See section 9.17 on page for the equations for other commonly used BSWFs.\n\n\n6.23 Appendix: Calculation of effective doses with R\n\n6.23.1 Introduction\nIf you use the R system for statistics (see, http://www.r-project.org/), or if you need an implementation with fewer restrictions, you may want to use R instead of Excel to calculate doses and action spectra. R is based on a real programming language called S and allows much flexibility. We have developed a package to facilitate these calculations. The package is called ‘UVcalc’ and will be soon submitted to CRAN (Comprehensive R archive network) and will be available also from this handbook’s web page. In addition to functions for calculating weighted and unweighted doses, and irradiance and from energy irradiance spectra, also functions for calculating photon ratios are provided.\n\n\n6.23.2 Calculating doses\nCurrently functions for five are implemented and are listed in Table [tab:R:dose:functions]. The functions take two arguments one vector giving the wavelengths and another vector giving the values of spectral energy irradiance at these wavelengths. The spectral irradiance or spectral exposure values would come either from measurements with a spectroradiometer or from model simulations. All functions accept a wavelengths vector with variable and arbitrary step sizes, with the condition that the wavelengths are sorted in strictly increasing order, something which is especially convenient when dealing with data from array spectrometers[^31].\nThe functions are made available by installing the package UVcalc (once) and loading it from the library when needed. To load the package into the workspace use library(UVcalc). Then load your spectral data into R using read.table() or read.csv().\nA file from a Macam spectroradiometer starts:\nWavelength(nm),W/m2\n270,0\n271,0\n272,1.17E-04\n273,2.42E-04\n274,4.55E-04\n275,8.94E-04\n276,0.00161\n277,0.00263\n278,0.00412\n279,0.00621\n280,0.00904\n281,0.01697\n282,0.02069\n283,0.02663\n284,0.03314\n285,0.04075\n286,0.04895\n287,0.05817\n288,0.0679\nFor a file like this one, use the code below but replacing \"name\" with the name and path to the data file. On Windows systems you need to scape backslashes in file paths like this: ‘\\\\’.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nIf our spectral irradiance data is in , and the wavelength in nm, as in the case of the Macam spectroradiometer, the functions will return the effective irradiance in .\nIf, for example, the spectral irradiance output by our model or spectroradiometer is in m, and the wavelengths are in Ångstrom then to obtain the effective irradiance in we will need to convert the units.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nIn this example, we take advantage of the behaviour of the S language: an operation between a scalar and vector, is equivalent to applying this operation to each member of the vector. Consequently, in the code above, each value from the vector of wavelengths is divided by 10, and each value in the vector of spectral irradiances is divided by 1000.\nIf the spectral irradiance is in then values should be multiplied by 10 to convert them to .\nIt is very important to make sure that the wavelengths are in nanometers as this is what the functions expect. If the wavelengths are in the wrong units, the BSWF will be wrongly calculated, and the returned value for effective irradiance will be wrong.\nIf we use as input to the functions instead of spectral irradiances, time-integrated spectral irradiances in , then the functions will return the effective exposure, or ‘dose’ in . Such time-integrated values are more frequently available as the output of models, or by integrating observed sequential values of spectral irradiance.\nIn addition to the functions for calculating biologically effective doses and effective irradiances, we provide functions for calculating unweighted doses or irradiances of (PPFD() or PAR.q.dose(), and PAR.e.dose()), (UVA.q.dose() and UVA.e.dose()) and (UVB.q.dose() and UVB.e.dose()), where ‘e’ variants return energy doses, and ‘q’ variants return quantum or photon doses. All functions expect as input radiation spectra in energy units, and wavelengths in nm.\n\n\n6.23.3 Calculating an action spectrum at given wavelengths\nThe functions available for calculating action spectra take as argument a vector of wavelengths, and return a vector of effectiveness (either quantum=photon or energy based) normalized to unity effectiveness at a wavelength of 300 nm except when indicated. These functions are listed in Table [tab:R:action:spectra:functions], and an example of their use follows. In these examples we generate the wavelengths vectors in R, but they can be also read from a file.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nAll functions accept a wavelengths vector with variable and arbitrary step sizes, with the condition that the wavelengths are sorted in strictly increasing order.\n\n\n6.23.4 Calculating photon ratios\nFunctions are also provided for calculating photon ratios between different pairs of wavebands. These functions are listed in Table [tab:R:photon:ratios:functions]. We follow the most frequently used wavelength ranges for the different colours, but also provide some generic functions that can be used when other limits are needed. Continuing with the example above in which my.data was read and attached we calculate UV-B : PAR photon ratio\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nThe spectral energy irradiance, can be in any energy based unit such as , or , as the multipliers cancel out when calculating the ratio. However, wavelengths must be always expressed in nanometers. Please, be aware that these functions will return erroneous values if used with spectra expressed as spectral photon irradiance, even though the returned values are photon ratios.\nPlease, be aware that following common practice in the literature, the wavelength range used for red light is different for the different photon ratios.\n\n\n6.23.5 Documentation\nThe package includes manual pages for the different functions, and an overview and a list of references for the original sources used. The definition of the functions can bee seen once the package is loaded by entering the name of the function without parameters or parentheses.\nThere are many resources on the R-System for Statistics and statistics in general available on-line. The most useful ones are The R Wiki (http://rwiki.sciviews.org/), and the documentation included in all R installations and accompanying each one of the different packages.\nSome classical books on R are those by Dalgaard (2002), Crawley (2005, 2007), and William N. Venables and Ripley (2002). The book by (W. N. Venables and Ripley 2000) discusses programming in S, the language used in R to build new functions and packages.\n\n\n\n6.24 Appendix: Suppliers of instruments\nIn this section we provide names and web addresses to some suppliers of instruments.

    "section": "6.22 Appendix: Calculation of effective doses with Excel",
    "text": "6.22 Appendix: Calculation of effective doses with Excel\nLet us start with a text file generated by a spectroradiometer and its connected computer. With the instruments that I have used this text file consists of one column, containing either spectral (energy) irradiance or spectral photon irradiance (some instruments, especially for underwater use, may have fluence rate instead of irradiance). At the start, above the columns, is a heading containing supplementary information. Other instruments may have two columns, the first one containing wavelength values, the other one spectral irradiance values.\nFor the Optronics instruments that I have used, the start of a data file looks like the listing in Figure [fig:list:Optronics]. The heading here contains “a”, which in this case is the name of the file, the kind of data that is recorded (including the unit), the date, the starting wavelength in nm, the end wavelength (not shown here) in nm, and the step interval in nm. This file can be loaded into an Excel file going to Data&gt;Get external data&gt;Load text file. When you have done this, insert a new column to the left of the one containing the measured data. In this new column you should fill in the wavelength values, which can be done in the following way without typing every value:\n\n\n\"a\",\"Irradiance [W/(cm^2 nm)]\",971217,250.00,400.00,1.00\n1.439562E-010\n1.797497E-010\n6.126532E-010\n4.516362E-009\n8.027722E-009\n1.081851E-009\n2.862175E-010\n1.728253E-010\n1.790998E-010\n1.953554E-010\n2.570309E-010\n...\n\n\nType the first two values, i.e. in this case first “250” in the cell left of the one containing the first radiation value 1.439562E-010. Since the step interval is 1.00 nm, the next value is 251. Type this in the cell to the left of the value 1.797497E-010. Select the two cells that you have just filled in. Put the cursor at the lower left corner of the cell containing “251” and see it change appearance, push the (left) mouse button and drag down to the cell left of the last radiation value. The column will then fill up with the appropriate wavelength values.\nYou have now filled columns A and B with the appropriate values. Next you should generate a column with values of the weighting function. Suppose you wish to use the weighting function of S. D. Flint and Caldwell (2003). The formula given for this in the publication is Biologically effective UV= \\exp[4.688272*\\exp(- \\exp(0.1703411*(x-307.867)/1.15))+((390-x)/121.7557-4.183832)] in which x stands for wavelength in nm.\nSelect cells in column C over the rows corresponding to values in columns A and B. Go to “Tools” on top of the file, push the mouse button and go down and select “Calculator”. Type the formula above, with the exceptions that you use ordinary parentheses instead of square brackets, “A:A” instead of “x” (do not type the quotation marks), and comma instead of dot if you use the comma system. When this is done, press OK and save the result.\nYou now have the values of the weighting function in column C. If you double-click on the first value in column C you should get the equation entered. The top of your file should then look like Figure [fig:Excel:sheet]. If you insert a new column C to the left of your old column C and copy the wavelength values into it you can plot your weighting function as a check. If you plot it on a logarithmic abscissa, it should look something like Figure [fig:Excel:PG]. This can be compared to the plot in the original publication by S. D. Flint and Caldwell (2003). Once you have generated a weighting function that you wish to use several times, you need of course not calculate it like this every time. You can simply transfer the column with it to a new sheet or a new Excel file. Since, as newly generated, it depends on another column, you need to use the command “Paste special” and choose “values”.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nNow you are ready to do the weighting itself. Select cells in column E in rows corresponding to the values in the other columns. Select the Calculator, and use it to multiply values in column B with the weighting function. Select an empty cell and go a final time to the Calculator. Select “Sum” and then the values you have just generated in column E. The sum you get in the cell you selected is the weighted radiation value. The number is, in this case, 0.000334759 and the unit is W cm^{-2}, which can also be expressed as 3.35 . The bottom of the file should look like Figure [fig:Excel:sheet:bottom]. I have written \\Sigma in one cell to remember that the value to the right of it is the sum of the values above it.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nNote that if you have another step size than 1 nm, you must multiply the sum by that step size. It is recommended that you do not use step sizes greater than 1 nm for UV-B spectra, since both the spectra themselves and the weighting functions are so steep.\nMartyn Caldwell’s traditional Generalized Plant Action Spectrum is easier to handle, and you should be able now to do a similar exercise with it yourself. A formula for this weighting function has been published by Green, Sawada, and Shettle (1974): Weighting function = 2.618\\cdot[1 -( \\lambda/313.3)2]\\cdot \\exp[-(\\lambda - 300)/31.08], where \\lambda stands for wavelength in nm. We abbreviate the name of this action spectrum as GEN(G) elsewhere in this text. See section 9.17 on page for the equations for other commonly used BSWFs.",

    "text": "6.23 Appendix: Calculation of effective doses with R\n\n6.23.1 Introduction\nIf you use the R system for statistics (see, http://www.r-project.org/), or if you need an implementation with fewer restrictions, you may want to use R instead of Excel to calculate doses and action spectra. R is based on a real programming language called S and allows much flexibility. We have developed a package to facilitate these calculations. The package is called ‘UVcalc’ and will be soon submitted to CRAN (Comprehensive R archive network) and will be available also from this handbook’s web page. In addition to functions for calculating weighted and unweighted doses, and irradiance and from energy irradiance spectra, also functions for calculating photon ratios are provided.\n\n\n6.23.2 Calculating doses\nCurrently functions for five are implemented and are listed in Table [tab:R:dose:functions]. The functions take two arguments one vector giving the wavelengths and another vector giving the values of spectral energy irradiance at these wavelengths. The spectral irradiance or spectral exposure values would come either from measurements with a spectroradiometer or from model simulations. All functions accept a wavelengths vector with variable and arbitrary step sizes, with the condition that the wavelengths are sorted in strictly increasing order, something which is especially convenient when dealing with data from array spectrometers[^31].\nThe functions are made available by installing the package UVcalc (once) and loading it from the library when needed. To load the package into the workspace use library(UVcalc). Then load your spectral data into R using read.table() or read.csv().\nA file from a Macam spectroradiometer starts:\nWavelength(nm),W/m2\n270,0\n271,0\n272,1.17E-04\n273,2.42E-04\n274,4.55E-04\n275,8.94E-04\n276,0.00161\n277,0.00263\n278,0.00412\n279,0.00621\n280,0.00904\n281,0.01697\n282,0.02069\n283,0.02663\n284,0.03314\n285,0.04075\n286,0.04895\n287,0.05817\n288,0.0679\nFor a file like this one, use the code below but replacing \"name\" with the name and path to the data file. On Windows systems you need to scape backslashes in file paths like this: ‘\\\\’.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nIf our spectral irradiance data is in , and the wavelength in nm, as in the case of the Macam spectroradiometer, the functions will return the effective irradiance in .\nIf, for example, the spectral irradiance output by our model or spectroradiometer is in m, and the wavelengths are in Ångstrom then to obtain the effective irradiance in we will need to convert the units.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nIn this example, we take advantage of the behaviour of the S language: an operation between a scalar and vector, is equivalent to applying this operation to each member of the vector. Consequently, in the code above, each value from the vector of wavelengths is divided by 10, and each value in the vector of spectral irradiances is divided by 1000.\nIf the spectral irradiance is in then values should be multiplied by 10 to convert them to .\nIt is very important to make sure that the wavelengths are in nanometers as this is what the functions expect. If the wavelengths are in the wrong units, the BSWF will be wrongly calculated, and the returned value for effective irradiance will be wrong.\nIf we use as input to the functions instead of spectral irradiances, time-integrated spectral irradiances in , then the functions will return the effective exposure, or ‘dose’ in . Such time-integrated values are more frequently available as the output of models, or by integrating observed sequential values of spectral irradiance.\nIn addition to the functions for calculating biologically effective doses and effective irradiances, we provide functions for calculating unweighted doses or irradiances of (PPFD() or PAR.q.dose(), and PAR.e.dose()), (UVA.q.dose() and UVA.e.dose()) and (UVB.q.dose() and UVB.e.dose()), where ‘e’ variants return energy doses, and ‘q’ variants return quantum or photon doses. All functions expect as input radiation spectra in energy units, and wavelengths in nm.\n\n\n6.23.3 Calculating an action spectrum at given wavelengths\nThe functions available for calculating action spectra take as argument a vector of wavelengths, and return a vector of effectiveness (either quantum=photon or energy based) normalized to unity effectiveness at a wavelength of 300 nm except when indicated. These functions are listed in Table [tab:R:action:spectra:functions], and an example of their use follows. In these examples we generate the wavelengths vectors in R, but they can be also read from a file.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nAll functions accept a wavelengths vector with variable and arbitrary step sizes, with the condition that the wavelengths are sorted in strictly increasing order.\n\n\n6.23.4 Calculating photon ratios\nFunctions are also provided for calculating photon ratios between different pairs of wavebands. These functions are listed in Table [tab:R:photon:ratios:functions]. We follow the most frequently used wavelength ranges for the different colours, but also provide some generic functions that can be used when other limits are needed. Continuing with the example above in which my.data was read and attached we calculate UV-B : PAR photon ratio\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nThe spectral energy irradiance, can be in any energy based unit such as , or , as the multipliers cancel out when calculating the ratio. However, wavelengths must be always expressed in nanometers. Please, be aware that these functions will return erroneous values if used with spectra expressed as spectral photon irradiance, even though the returned values are photon ratios.\nPlease, be aware that following common practice in the literature, the wavelength range used for red light is different for the different photon ratios.\n\n\n6.23.5 Documentation\nThe package includes manual pages for the different functions, and an overview and a list of references for the original sources used. The definition of the functions can bee seen once the package is loaded by entering the name of the function without parameters or parentheses.\nThere are many resources on the R-System for Statistics and statistics in general available on-line. The most useful ones are The R Wiki (http://rwiki.sciviews.org/), and the documentation included in all R installations and accompanying each one of the different packages.\nSome classical books on R are those by Dalgaard (2002), Crawley (2005, 2007), and William N. Venables and Ripley (2002). The book by (W. N. Venables and Ripley 2000) discusses programming in S, the language used in R to build new functions and packages.",

    "text": "7.1 Introduction to leaf optics\nThe optical properties of whole leaves depend on the pigment content and the localization of these pigments, but there is also a large contribution of tissue structural properties that through light scattering increase the distance travelled by photons within leaves (Johnsen 2011; Lee 2010). Uneven distribution of pigments has also consequences for the relationship between concentration and light absorption. Absorption of photons by chlorophylls and auxiliary pigments is a pre-requisite for photosynthesis. Non-photosynthetic pigments are also important as they can screen potentially damaging UV photons. Photoreceptors are in too low a concentration to significantly affect optical properties of leaves, but the properties of light that inpings on them is affected by these properties interacting with their localization.\nMany studies have indicated that UV-absorbing compounds in the vacuoles of epidermal cells have a major role in regulating internal UV levels. However, absorbing compounds located in cell walls and other cell parts can also be important in controlling internal UV penetration. These compounds are usually not easily extractable, and consequently one cannot rely on extracts alone when judging the effectiveness of UV-screening protection. Furthermore, both wax deposits and pubescence may be very important for protection against ultraviolet radiation (Karabourniotis and Bornman 1999; Holmes and Keiller 2002). The amount of protection can also vary over time, even during the day, probably as a result of changes in flavonoid concentrations (Barnes et al. 2008; Veit et al. 1996). The expression of these protection mechanisms is plastic, i.e., subject to acclimation. Thus, expression of leaf properties conferring protection also depend on environmental factors, in particular prior exposure to UV radiation or strong visible radiation, and large differences in genotype and phenotype exist among plant species and to a lesser extent within species.\nAs absorbed radiative energy contributes to the energy balance of leaves, the evolution of leaf optical properties in hot climates has been influenced by features that help prevent excessive warming of leaves (Lee 2010). In addition to tissue and cell damage by extreme temperatures, the rates of transpiration, photosynthesis and respiration depend on temperature.\nThis chapter is organized broadly around optical properties relevant to photosynthesis, screening of UV radiation and the energy balance of plants. We also describe the application of similar methods to the description of the optical properties of flowers.",

    "section": "7.2 Whole leaves",
    "text": "7.2 Whole leaves\n\n7.2.1 Spectroscpy\nSpectroscopy of reflected radiation is the basis of optical remote sensing, in the case of drones, aeroplanes and satellites. Spectroscopy can be also a very useful measuring approach at the scale of individual plants and plant organs, including leaves. Reflectance, absorptance and transmittance of whole leaves and flower petals and sepals informs about combined effects of pigments and structural features.\nIt is important to remember when studying plants that light scattering plays a very important role in determining optical properties (Lee 2010). One possible way of quantifying scattering within leaves is to measure the time a very brief laser pulse takes to travel across a leaf, from adaxial to abaxial epidermis (L.O. Björn, personal communication). A way of visualizing the contribution to light scattering of the water-air interfaces within leaves is to infiltrate the air spaces with water in a vacuum chamber. If we infiltrate a variegated leaf, the white parts lacking chlorophyll turn almost transparent and the dark green regions containing chlorophyll become semi-transparent with a green tint. This demonstrates that scattering increases the probability of photons being absorbed. This increase results from lengthening the path of photons within the leaf and a concomitant increase in the probability of each photon being intercepted by a pigment molecule.\nThe surface of leaves varies among species and also through acclimation within a single genotype or even parts of an individual. Not only pubescence and whitish wax deposits on the surface of leaves affect reflectance, also the shine of the surface resulting from its smoothness affects how reflectance varies with the light incidence angle. Phenomena at the surface interface affect light passage in both directions, both in-going and out-going photons. This is probably why only leaves that receive light equally from both sides have similar surface and epidermal properties in adaxial and abaxial epidermes. Surface properties also affect wettability, accumulation of dirt and interactions with insects and microbes. In the case of flowers, not only pigments play a role in their colours. In some cases, very-small-scale surface properties contribute to enhancing their colours, or even creating them by interference effects. In general, colours generated through interference by micro-structure vary with the angle between a light beam and the surface, e.g., petal or leaf epidermis. We see this incidence-abgle-dependence as iridescence. For example, the colour of tulip flowers is based on pigments but intensified by structural features at the surface.\nFor spectroscopic measurement of optical properties we need a light source, references, and a spectrometer. Measurements are relative to reference standards, e.g., white standard tiles with very high and known spectral reflectance across or waveelngths of interest. The light source must have a stable or consistent enough light output to allow comparable sequential measurements. As reference standards are used for each measurement, the spectrometer needs to be calibrated for wavelength and a linearization function available. However, an irradiance calibration is not needed. There are two approaches in common use to collect the reflected light, a probe with a narrow aperture angle, or an integrating sphere. With a probe, we measure only part the the reflected light, collinear with the incident light beam, but possibly at different angles to the surface of the leaf. When using an integrating sphere, the incident beam is most frequently is within 10 degrees of normal to the surface, and the integrating sphere collects radiation reflected in all directions. These to approaches provide measurements that are not comparable. Furthermore, the effect of physical surface properties is different.\nThe best material for reference “tiles” is Spectralon, a fluoropolymer. It exhibits highly Lambertian behavior, and very high reflectance (&gt;0.95 from 250 nm to 2500 nm). Spectralon is fairly tolerant of handling, thus in this respect better than Barium sulphate in the form of compacted powder or sprays. Sets of Spectralon tiles with different calibrated reflectance values are commercially available, with tiles of different strengths having each a nearly constant reflectance across a wide range of wavelengths. Their drawback is that they are expensive, even at small sizes, and that must the handled carefully so as not to affect their calibrated reflection properties. For measuring low reflectance values accurately, the use of “grey” tiles of comparable reflectance to the object measured is recommended, as using a white tile assumes perfect linearity of the spectrometer’s response. Grey Spectralon tiles contain some carbon black to decrease reflectance. A set of four 1.25” tiles, white, and grayscale costs over 1\\,500€ uncalibrated, and nearly 2\\,000€ with a traceable calibrating (early 2025 prices).\nWhile for accurate (spectral) reflectance measurements we need reference tiles, for transmittance, in practice we normally block the light path or remove of the measured object out of the path, once again assuming linearity. A calibrated neutral density (ND) filter can play a similar role as a grey tile for reflectance. Absorptance, is calculated by difference from the measured spectral reflectance and transmittance. See chapter Radiation-matter Interactions and Optics for the theory and calculation details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative white references\n\n\n\nLess expensive than a Spectralon standard is a slab of commercial grade fluoropolymer PTFE (e.g., Teflon) &gt;6 mm thick. In fact, Spectralon is made of synthered pure PTFE powder, with enhanced scattering properties. Only high quality non-recycled PTFE is pure enough to be used as a white reference. The need for a thick slab of solid PTFE to subtitute for Spectralon is because it scatters less. The best approach is to use a Spectralon tile as a reference to measure the PTFE tile, i.e., transferring the calibration from a known-good standard to much cheaper working standards. All references must scatter the light they reflect, so their surface must look mat rather than shiny. To prevent specular reflections from the surface of PTFE slabs, their surface must be wet-sanded with a fine grit (e.g., 600) sand paper. A solid PTFE slab can be washed to clean it, and even sanded again if its surface gets marred.\nA substitute for a calibrated black tile can be based on black flocking as used on the inside of optical instruments, special black paint used for this same purpose, or special artist’s black paints. Paints must provide a fully mat, or scattering, surface once dry. As with PTFE slabs, the reflectance can be compared to that of calibrated black standard. Artists’ paint sold under the name of Black 3.0 from Culture Hustle has very high absorbance in both visible and NIR regions of the spectrum (This supplier has provided me with spectral data showing that the blackness of Black 3.0 extends into the NIR.) Black 4.0 also from Culture Hustle might also work as it is even less reflective in the visible, but I lack spectral data for it and its surface has been reported as fragile. Musou Black (available here)[https://www.musoublack.com/] is NIR reflective but might be useful in VIS. There is a compromise, as the more pigment a paint contains the more fragile the painted surface becomes. Black 3.0 is non-toxic while Musou black is reported to have an obnoxious smell. As long as spectral reflectance is known, a grey reference can be used with additional simple calculations. White paints on the other hand, are in many cases unsuitable as they frequently contain fluorescent pigments to enhance their apparent reflectivity, thus modify the spectrum of the incident light that they reflect.\nOf course, using secondary standards will always degrade accuracy compared to using calibrated Spectralon tiles.\n\n\n\n\n7.2.2 Optical estimation of chlorophyll content\nAs explained above, both pigments and scattering affect transmittance in a heterogeous medium such as leaves. A simple measurement of leaf transmittance at a wavelength where chlorophyll absorbs strongly enough provides a rough estimate of the concentration of chlorophyll, that can be used with a suitable case-specific calibration. This requires very simple equipment, but is rather impractical as readings are highly dependent scattering within leaves. Two commercially available instruments, the SPAD-502Plus (Konica Minolta), CCM-200 (Opti-Sciences) and the Dualex 4.0 (METOS, Pessl Instruments) apply a correction based on the transmittance in the NIR, where leaves have very low absorptance and scattering predominates. The Dualex 4 measures transmittance at a wavelength in the NIR (near 710 nm, i.e., close to the so-called “red edge”), thus outside the region of maximum absorption of chlorophylls, using an even longer wavelength (near 820 nm) as reference for scattering. In contrast, the CCM-200 uses 653 nm and 931 nm, and the SPAD-502 uses the very similar 650 nm and 940 nm. So these instruments measure absorbance in the red where chlorophyll absorption is higher than at 710 nm, while using a reference in the NIR. In all cases, using a reference-based correction for scattering makes the calibration against chlorophyll concentration less dependent on leaf anatomy and species. Thus, for within-experiment comparisons, in many cases it is possible to rely on calibrations that are only instrument dependent (Markwell, Osterman, and Mitchell (1995)). Still, for accurate measurements expressed as chlorophyll concentration per unit leaf area, a calibration against photometric measurements in leaf extracts can be necessary. The values returned by the SPAD instrument are in arbitrary units and their relationship to concentration is slightly curvilinear. The Dualex returns approximate concentration values in \\mu g\\, cm^{-2} based on a built-in generic, and thus, approximate calibration. The relationship between these estimates and true concentration is linear in the case of the Dualex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciple of operation\n\n\n\nA small light source and a light detector located on opposite sides of the leaf can provide an estimate of leaf transmittance. The simplest possible approach to estimate chlorophyll concentration in vivo is to use a red LED (660 nm), or NIR (710 nm), and a silicon photodiode. A LED driver must ensure stable illumination and the current generated by the photodiode can be measured with a suitable ammeter, or using a shunt resistor, measured with a sensitive voltmeter. Such a device can in many cases assembled at minimal expense, and if used in a darkened room the only key requirement is consistent alignment between LED and photodiode. However, a calibration curve must be measured over a range of known chlorophyll concentrations extracted from leaves and repeated for each species, genotype and experiment, possibly even treatments. This approach works (e.g., Casal, Aphalo, and Sánchez (1987) and ?fig-BROCHE) but because of the need of frequent calibrations, it is tedious in practice.\n\n\n\nThe device used by Casal, Aphalo, and Sánchez (1987) was crudely built using a wood cloth-peg into which holes were drilled to install a LED and a photodiode into opposite halves.\n\n\nFigure 7.1\n\n\n\nMost commercial instruments use this same approach but with two light sources, as described above, one used to measure the decrease in transmittance not attributable to chlorophyll (in NIR) and one to estimate this effect together with that attributable to chlorophyll (in red or nearby region). The principle remains the same, but using absorption of NIR as a reference makes calibrations less dependent on those leaf properties that affect absorption but are unrelated to the concentration of chlorophyll. These chlorophyll meters also have a small light-tight chamber to avoid interference from ambient light. To improve this separation even further, a wavelength selective filter on the photodiode can be used to isolate the wavelengths emitted by the LED(s) from those in ambient light. It should be mentioned here, that paired measurements in the red and NIR regions are also strongly recommended when measuring chlorophyll extracts in the lab with a spectrophotometer. The stability of Konika-Minolta SPAD-502 and Opti-Science CCM-200 readings among units and across species has been reviewed (Parry, Blonquist, and Bugbee (2014)). A significant effect of chloroplast accumulation on SPAD readings has been reported (Hoel and Solhaug (1998)), and should be taken into account when designing measuring protocols.\n\n\nThe variability of non-destructive in situ optical estimates is rather high making abundant replication important both for measurements and calibration curves (e.g., Figure 7.2). On ther other hand, measurements take only a few seconds and being non-destructive, the same leaves can be repeatedly measured over their life.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(Chl.data, aes(SPAD, ChlTot, color = species)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  stat_function(fun = function(x) {exp(log(10^(x^0.2672137)))}, \n                color = \"black\", xlim = range(Chl.data$SPAD)) +\n  annotate(geom = \"text\", x = 0, y = 1250, \n           label = \"10^italic(S)^0.2672\", \n           parse = TRUE, size = 5, hjust = \"inward\") +\n  labs(x = expression(\"SPAD Index,\"*italic(S)), \n       y = expression(\"Chlorophyll \"*(mu*mol~m^{-2})),\n       colour = \"Baobab species:\") +\n  theme_bw(16) + theme(legend.position = \"top\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: Fitted SPAD-502 callibration curve for three species of Malagasy baobab (Adansonia). A. grandidieri, A. madagascariensis, A. rubrostipa. Reference total chlorophyll concentrations from extracts in N,N-dimethylformamide measured spectroscopically (see Randriamanana et al. 2012).\n\n\n\n\n\nVariability and consequent uncertainty increase as the chlorophyll concentration increases because the number of target photons reaching the detector decreases making the relative effect of other optical and electronic disturbances larger. In the Dualex 4.0, the measurement of transmittance at the shoulder rather than at the top of the peak of absorption decreases this problem. Being the basic principle simple, several competing devices are available for measuring chlorophyll in vivo . For example, this is one of the parameters measured by the Walz LSA-250 leaf state analizer using the same approach as in the Dualex, and by the Opti-Science MPM-100 multi pigment meter. I NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT WAVELENGTHS ARE USED BY THE MPM-100, possibly also close to 710 nm. The functions of these instruments dependent on using chlorophyll fluorescence as a reporter of UV screening are described in a later section.\nThe SPAD-502, CCM-200 and Dualex-4 are good examples of two frequently used approaches, but given the usefulness of in-vivo chlorophyll measurements, there are additional instruments available. Opti-Sciences current CCM-200Plus chlorophyll meter, returns Chlorophyll Content Index (CCI) values. In contrast, Apogee’s extrenally almost identical MC-100 chlorophyll meter uses a built-in calibrations for multiple plant species, reporting area-based chlorophyll concentrations in \\mathrm{\\mu mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2 of leaf surface, while also able to report results in SPAD and CCI units. Other SPAD quasi-clones are available: Hansatech CL-01 Chlorophyll Meter (660 nm, 940 nm), using its own uncalibrated units for expressing concentration values, In addition, several different chlorophyll meters are available from different suppliers, including AliExpress for a low price of 300 to 500 €. Most of them, look externally like clones of the SPAD, and return values in SPAD units. Seevral of them, even if sold under different brand names, and showing slight variations in external appearance seem to be functionally almost identical. A recent study suggests that at some of these cheap instruments are able to provide as good estimates of chlorophyll concentrations as the SPAD-502 or the CCM-200 (Brown, Williams, and Dash (2022)). For a chlorophyll meter to provide readings in SPAD units consitent with those reported by the SPAD-502, they must use the same, or very similar, wavelengths to the SPAD-502.\nOf course, spectral transmittance can be used to estimate chlorophyll concentration in vivo (e.g., Casal, Aphalo, and Sánchez (1987)). However, estimates from the simpler instruments described above seem to be as good once a calibration is used (Brown, Williams, and Dash (2022)).\nIt is also possible to estimate chlorophyll concentration from reflectance. This is possible as a result of light scattering. Some of the photons entering the leaf and scattered within it will exit through the same epidermis through which they entered into the leaf, creating a spectral signature in the apparent reflectance dependent on the concentration of chlorophyll. This approach is in practice used when transmittance cannot be measured, for example, in remote sensing.\n\n\n7.2.3 Monitoring of chloroplast accumulation",

    "text": "7.4 Chlorophyll fluorescence as a reporter of UV screening\n\n7.4.1 Old text (to merge below or delete)\nThis method has so far only been employed by excitation and measurement at the leaf surface. It thus mainly monitors penetration of UV radiation through the epidermis into the chlorophyll-containing mesophyll, i.e. transmission through the epidermis. Chlorophyll fluorescence excited by blue light usually serves as a standard (Bilger et al. 1997; Bilger, Johnsen, and Schreiber 2001), more recently excitation by red light has also been used to avoid interference by anthocyanins (Goulas et al. 2004). The principle has been used in commercial instruments that assess the UV absorbance of the epidermis (Kolb et al. 2005; Goulas et al. 2004). The first portable instruments, UVA-PAM and Dualex FLAV used UV-A radiation for excitation rather than UV-B radiation, but now there is at least one instrument, Dualex HCA, measuring UV-B absorbance.\nIn principle, chlorophyll fluorescence could also be used for monitoring UV penetration in another way, by recording fluorescence in cross-sections of leaves, as has already been done for the penetration of visible light (T. C. Vogelmann and Han 2000; T. C. Vogelmann and Evans 2002; Gould et al. 2002).\n\n\n7.4.2 Introduction\nFor protection against the detrimental action of UV radiation plants use UV absorbing compounds which are located primarily in external tissues such as the epidermis of leaves. There, they act as filters, or “screens”, protecting the sensitive targets of UV radiation in the tissues below. The extent of this protection is strongly dependent on environmental conditions (Pescheck & Bilger 2020), especially exposure to UV-B radiation, high light and low temperature, but also nitrogen deficiency and high CO2 concentrations enhance the synthesis and accumulation of UV screening compounds. In addition, screening may change during the development of leaves. Therefore, it is a priori unknown if two different leaves of the same species display also the same UV protection. However, for the reproducibility and interpretation of experiments testing the UV sensitivity of plants, it is important to know the amount of radiation absorbed in the epidermis before it can reach sensitive targets within the leaf. On the other hand, the effects of the environment on the accumulation of screening pigments can be much easier studied, when the latter can be determined in intact plant leaves.\nFirst determinations of the depth to which UV radiation penetrates into a leaf were accomplished using fine quartz fibres, which were slowly led through a leaf (Bornman and Vogelmann 1988). This technique is very elaborate, requiring, e.g., a precise measurement of the depth of penetration, such that only very few laboratories in the world were able to apply it. Furthermore, the technique is destructive and requires rather stable research objects. It cannot be used with mosses or algae.\nA method restricted to even fewer plants species in which large-enough pieces of epidermis can be peeled or dissected is to directly measure spectral transmittance of the isolated epidermis with a spectrometer ((BarnesXXX?)). This not only involves the in many cases difficult task of separating the epidermis, but also maintaining its integrity during the course of the measurements.\nThe drawbacks of these methods are avoided by a technique, which uses chlorophyll fluorescence excitation by a UV measuring beam (Bilger et al. 1997). Based on the measuring principle described below, several commercially available devices were developed, of which the Dualex Scientific originally manufactured by Force A (France) in various versions, has been the most popular in recent years. This technique takes advantage of the high transmittance of the epidermis in the visible region, including those of the chlorophyll fluorescence.\n\n\n7.4.3 UV-induced chlorophyll fluorescence as a reporter\nThe measuring principle of all devices basing on chlorophyll fluorescence excitation depends on two preconditions. First, the chlorophyll fluorescence intensity is proportional to the irradiance absorbed by the chlorophyll and a yield factor, which is dependent on the state of photosystem II. (To be correct, also the state of PS I may have a certain influence. This is, however, only relevant at high excitation densities, which are not used here. Therefore, PS I fluorescence contributes with a constant fraction to the fluorescence intensity.) As long as the electrons transferred by PSII to the primary acceptor QA do not accumulate there, the yield factor remains constant. This is the case when the light received by PS II is sufficiently weak. Then, the fluorescence intensity is dependent only on the number of quanta reaching the chloroplasts.\n\n\nNormalized absorbance spectra of chlorophyll a (isolated from Asterocapsa nidulans (N.L. Gardner) Komárek & Komárková-Legnerová) and chlorophyll b (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich) in 100% methanol.\n\nSecond, chlorophyll must absorb UV radiation. This is indeed the case, as absorption spectra of chlorophyll a and b reveal (?fig-chl-bilger). Given these facts, the fluorescence yield of a (UV) measuring beam depends on the fraction of it that reaches chloroplasts. In higher plant leaves, the measuring beam must pass the epidermis, which is largely free of chloroplasts, before chlorophyll fluorescence can be excited. Hence, UV absorbing compounds located in epidermal vacuoles or cell walls will affect fluorescence emission. In lower plants, such as ferns and algae, UV absorbing compounds located in external cell walls can fulfil this function (e.g., Pescheck et al. 2014). Since fluorescence emission is also affected by independent factors such as the measuring geometry, the amount of chlorophyll in the leaves, scattering properties of the anatomical structure of the leaves, or in some measuring arrangements simply by the sample size, a reference beam is used which is similarly affected by these factors but not absorbed by screening pigments. In the early measuring apparatus, a blue reference beam was used (Bilger et al. 1997, 2001), since it was assumed that at this wavelength scattering within the leaf would be most similar to the scattering of the UV measuring beam. Later it was recognized that the fluorescence yield of a blue beam is dependent on the amount of the xanthophyll cycle carotenoids in the chloroplasts (Pfündel et al. 2007, Nichelmann et al. 2016), and a red reference beam is used nowadays. ?fig-fluor-principle-bilger shows a scheme of the measuring principle as implemented in the UVA-PAM and Dualex. In the UVA-PAM, both excitation and measurement take place on the same epidermis, while in the Dualex, the fluorescence is detected on the opposite surface of the leaf. Both excitation beams have to pass the epidermis. UV absorbing pigments in the epidermis reduce the intensity of the UV beam, whereas this is not the case for the red reference beam. The latter as well as the emitted chlorophyll fluorescence will not be absorbed in the epidermis and be similarly scattered by it.\n\n\nSchematic illustration of the measuring principle showing the cross section of the upper cells of a leaf. UV-absorbing compounds in the epidermis attenuate the UV excitation beam, whereas the red excitation beam and the chlorophyll fluorescence excited by the two beams are passing the epidermis unhindered. The ratio between UV- and red-excited fluorescence, F(UV) / F(R), is dependent on the amount of UV-absorbing compounds between the leaf surface and the chloroplasts.\n\nWe need a whole-leaf cross section and to distinguish the approach currently shown, used in the UVA-PAM and the approach used in the Dualex with fluorescence assessed on the opposite side of the leaf. We need also to find-out what approch is used ib the LSA-2050, the MPM-100 and other readily available chlorophyll meters.\n\n\n7.4.4 Calculating UV transmittance\nThe ratio of the UV-induced fluorescence to the red-induced fluorescence (F(UV) / F(R)) is also dependent on the intensities of the measuring beams. In order to calculate a transmittance of the UV beam, it is necessary to know F(UV) / F(R) induced in the absence of any absorbing pigments with identical measuring beam intensities. For most investigated plants, such a state cannot be reached easily. Therefore, various approaches have been used to come as close as possible to such a reference value for 100% transmittance. In our hands, Epipremnum aureum growing in a room far away from a window showed 100% UV-A transmittance and high UV-B transmittance on the adaxial leaf side. However, such high transmittances are extremely exceptional. In the vast majority of plant species, it would be necessary to remove the epidermis, which again is not possible in most plants. However, there exist species where at least the abaxial epidermis can be removed, and in some cases, this is even possible with the adaxial epidermis. Especially plants with succulent or at least slightly succulent leaves are amenable. To these plants belong many species from the family Crassulaceae, but also Vicia faba, Pisum sativum and Viola tricolor. Primary leaves from grasses, such as Hordeum vulgare, proved successful for peeling the epidermis. At growth conditions strongly inducing the formation of screening compounds, these may accumulate also in mesophyll cells (Agati et al. 2011). Therefore, shade acclimated leaves grown at optimal temperatures should be used for the 100% transmittance standard.\n\n\nFluorescence excitation ratios determined with a Xe-PAM fluorometer (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany; Bilger et al. 1997) from 5 dicotyledoneous species (circles) and 6 varieties from 4 monocotyledoneous species grown from fall 2000 to spring 2001 at Ås, Norway, in a phytotron at 21°C (closed symbols) or at 9°C (open symbols). Excitation ratios using a UV-A beam (left panel) or a UV-B beam (right panel) with reference to a broad blue-green (BG) excitation beam were determined from abaxial sides of leaves before (x-axis) and after (y-axis) removal of the epidermis. The following species and varieties were used: Arabidopsis thaliana acc. Columbia, Pisum sativum subsp. sativum cv. axiphium, Brassica napus cv. Bambu, Brassica rapa cv. Agneta, Vicia faba cv. Witkiem, Hordeum vulgare cv. Frost, H. vulgare cv. Tyra, Secale cereale cv. Danko, S. cereale cv. Rogo, Triticale cv. Prego, Triticum aestivum cv. Bastian. Unpublished data by Mari Rolland and Wolfgang Bilger.\n\nWhen using Poaceae, one has to bear in mind that these often contain ferulic acid derivatives in their cell walls (Harris and Hartley 1980). Hence, removing the epidermis of species from this family may not remove all UV, especially UV-B, protection (?fig-fluo-ratios-bilger). Besides cell wall located absorbing compounds, also scattering properties of the mesophyll cells and potentially the chlorophyll a/b ratio may affect the F(UV) / F(R) ratio. These and other still unknown factors may contribute to the observed variability of the F(UV) /F(R) ratios from epidermis free leaves of different species, even when selecting leaves from non-inducing conditions. This is demonstrated in Fig. 3, which shows data for F(UV) / F(BG) ratios from epidermis free leaves of various species, plotted against the same ratios obtained with intact leaves. The lower the fluorescence ratio of the intact leaf was, the lower was also the ratio of the epidermis free leaf. In addition, also the maximal fluorescence ratios of the epidermis free leaves vary among the different species. Since one is forced quite often to use the reference ratio from a different species for the investigated species, some caution is necessary in the interpretation of the absolute transmittance values calculated. An uncertainty of about 10% transmittance due to an inappropriate reference value must be accepted. As an alternative, it is possible to use isolated chloroplasts as reference. In these cases, chloroplasts should be applied to a filter paper or a glass fibre filter in a concentration sufficiently high to mimic the chlorophyll content per leaf area in the investigated species (Bilger et al. 1997, Nichelmann et al. 2017). This approach is needed, e.g., when algae or ferns are investigated (Pescheck et al. 2014).\nIn the most popular device, the Dualex Scientific instrument, the reference value of F(UV) / F(R) for 100% transmittance has been set at the factory and cannot be changed afterwards. Unfortunately, this value may vary among different instruments, as evidenced recently in an instrument intercomparison. Advantages of the non-destructive measurements Using the available portable devices rapid measurements are possible characterizing the photoprotection of leaves as well as their content of protective compounds. For the former trait, the expression as transmittance of the protective tissue/layer is most helpful. Transmittance characterizes the percentage of incident damaging radiation that reaches the chloroplasts. These contain one the most prominent targets of UV-A and UV-B radiation, the water-splitting complex of PS II (Hakala et al. 2005). With this information, it is even possible to compare after an experimental UV exposure the inflicted damage with the amount of radiation reaching the target. This calculation has been used to show that the basic sensitivity of PS II was not different in macroalgae species containing or lacking screening compounds in their cell walls (Pescheck et al. 2014).\nFrom transmittance, absorbance can be calculated, which according to the Lambert-Beer law is proportional to the concentration of absorbing compounds. Hence, what has been called the log fluorescence excitation ratio (log FER; Goulas et al 2004) can be used as a proxy for the amount of UV absorbing pigments in the epidermis. Since the Dualex instrument uses an LED emitting in the UV-A spectral region, where preferentially flavonoids are absorbing, the absorbance parameter calculated by the instrument at this wavelength was termed “Flav value”. However, one should be aware that each UV-absorbing compound adds to the total screening according its own extinction coefficient, which may strongly vary among different compounds. Therefore, the true concentration of specific compounds in the protective layer cannot be simply inferred without further wet chemical analysis. Although usage of the term Flav suggests that (mainly) flavonoids may be responsible for the screening at 365-375 nm, it is also possible that solely hydroxycinnamic acids are used as photoprotectants in this spectral region. For sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) it was shown that the leaves contain only trace amounts of flavonoids and the screening is solely due to chlorogenic acid and its derivatives (Stelzner et al. 2019), which have their spectral absorbance maximum at 330 nm and display only residual absorption around 365 nm. Accordingly, these compounds must have a much higher concentration to reach the same UV-A protection than a flavonoid such as, e.g., quercetin derivatives.\nThe non-destructive nature of the measurements allows the repeated observation the identical leaf. This allows following the acclimation kinetics of leaves after a change in specific environmental conditions. This is extremely helpful in investigating signal transduction pathways and the evaluation of various environmental conditions, which may trigger the biosynthesis, and accumulation of protective compounds.\nThe ease of measurements and the portability of the devices allows extensive measurements under natural conditions. E.g., the UV-A-PAM-fluorometer (Gademann Instruments, Germany) has been used to follow protection against natural gradients in UV-B radiation (Barnes et al. 2015). Solanki et al. (2019) observed the time course of UV screening over a year in leaves of Vaccinium vitis-ideae.",

    "text": "7.5 Additional parameters\nThe measuring wavelength can be adjusted to the absorption spectra of the compounds of interest. With the advent of the availability of LEDs emitting in the UV-B, it has become possible manufacturing instruments capable to measure epidermal transmittance around 310 nm. At this wavelength region, both, hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives and flavonoids absorb radiation. Furthermore, at this wavelength the damaging potential of UV radiation is even larger and the determination of protection is closer to the most important stress factor.\nWhen using green light for the measuring beam, anthocyanins can be addressed, which have an absorption maximum in this wavelength region and which serve as photoprotectants in the PAR (Gould 2004, Nichelmann et al. 2017, Pfündel et al. 2007). Applying this rationale, the Dualex Scientific instrument provides also an anthocyanin index. However, this index needs to be considered with caution. Absorptance of a leaf in the green spectral region is much lower than in the red region. Therefore, decreases in chlorophyll content will first affect absorptance and, hence, fluorescence excitation, in the green region, before the absorptance of the red reference beam is affected. With decreasing chlorophyll content, the excitation ratio F(green) / F(red) will decline even in the absence of anthocyanins (see Nichelmann et al. 2017). In principle, the same considerations should apply also for the UV spectral region, since there absorbance of chlorophyll is lower than at the absorbance peak in the red. However, the difference in absorbance to the red region is much lower for UV than for green light. Therefore, F(UV) / F(red) should be much less affected by changes in chlorophyll content than F(green) / F(red).\nIn the blue wavelength region, carotenoids located in the pigment protein complexes in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplasts compete with chlorophyll for excitation energy. Whereas lutein and neoxanthin transfer almost 100% the absorbed excitation to chlorophyll, -carotene is much less efficient (around 30%) and violaxanthin and its de-epoxidation products antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin are entirely unable to transfer energy to chlorophyll (Caffari et al. 2001). The latter pigments show an enhanced content in chloroplasts relative to chlorophyll when plants are growing at high light (Thayer & Björkman 1989). This enhancement can be as high as a factor of 5, when plants grown in full sunlight are compared to plants grown in deep shade. Hence, the relative absorption of blue light by the pigments of the violaxanthin cycle and the according loss of excitation energy for chlorophyll will increase in high light grown leaves. Accordingly, the relative excitation efficiency at around 470 nm can be used as an indicator of the pool size of the violaxanthin cycle pigments (Nichelmann et al 2016). Recently, it has been shown in leaves of rocket (Diplotaxis tenuifolia), that the excitation efficiency at 470 nm follows also the dynamic changes in carotenoid content in single leaves when these are exposed to changes in irradiance (Khoramizadeh et al. 2024). It needs to pointed out, that at this wavelength range only a relative excitation efficiency can be determined, which cannot be described in terms of transmittance. Nevertheless, comparison to the maximal excitation efficiency observed in shade acclimated leaves is possible and relative trends can be deduced. With the LSA-2050 device (Walz GmbH, Germany), which contains also an LED for excitation at 450 nm, such measurements have become recently easily possible.\nIn addition to the pigment detection using chlorophyll fluorescence, the available devices use also measurements of transmittance through the leaves to quantify chlorophyll content. For this purpose, a wavelength absorbed by chlorophyll and one that is too long to be absorbed by chlorophyll are used. The latter serves as a reference, allowing correction for non-specific scattering properties of the leaves. It has proven advantageous to use a wavelength at the long wavelength tail of the chlorophyll absorption spectrum, which enhances the linear range of the relationship between absorbance and pigment content (Cerovic et al. 2012).\nA further helpful information for field measurements is the use of a GPS sensor for locating the measured leaf. Using this technique allowed to map the pigment contents of grapevine leaves and use this information to draw a map of nutrient requirements in the respective vineyard (Cerovic….) .\nRecently, also sensors for leaf orientation and angle were included in a device, which combined with data on the date and location makes it possible to deduce the relative sun exposure of the investigated leaf.",

    "text": "7.6 Precautions and pitfalls\nWhen using chlorophyll fluorescence for assessing the function of PS II, the short-term pre-illumination history and the simultaneous irradiation of the leaf are of utmost importance. For the measurement of epidermal transmittance, necessary precautions are much less severe. Since after darkening of a leaf rapid changes of the fluorescence are finished after a few minutes, measurements with devices, which use a sequential irradiation of the sample with the different measuring beams, can be accomplished without problem 2 min after darkening a leaf. With devices using quasi simultaneous irradiation with all measuring beams such as the Dualex instruments, in principle no dark acclimation of the leaves is needed. This is specifically useful in field investigations.\nAs is always the case with measuring instruments, calibration of the used devices should be checked. Ideally the device should be sent to the manufacturer in regular time intervals. For a control when a calibration at the manufacturer is needed again, standards can be used to compare the stability of the signals with time. A physical standard could be a plastic foil with fluorescence excitation and emission spectra similar to those of chlorophyll. Helpful are also plants grown under standardized conditions. For example, Vicia faba, or any other plant species from which the epidermis can be easily peeled, grown under low irradiance will provide a quite stable reference system. Intercomparison among several devices in regular time intervals is also helpful to detect any changes in the performance of an instrument.\nThe existence of diel time courses of UV screening in leaves has been demonstrated for several plant species (Barnes et al. 2016). Although these species seem rather an exception, the absence of such short term variations should always be checked. When these are observed, one should be careful before deducing an according rapid metabolisation of the responsible screening pigments.\nWith its introduction the fluorescence method was coined as a method for the determination of epidermal UV transmittance or epidermal UV screening. However, although the majority of UV protection is achieved by UV absorbing compounds located in the epidermis of leaves (see, e.g., Burchard et al. 2000), a contribution by compounds in the mesophyll cannot be excluded. This has become very obvious when investigating the screening properties of anthocyanins in Berberis thunbergii, a species in whose leaves the anthocyanins are only located in the mesophyll. Despite this location, screening of up to 50% of integrated solar irradiation was calculated (Nichelmann et al. 2017). After growth at conditions strongly inducing the accumulation of screening pigments, leaves from which the epidermis was removed also showed reduced UV fluorescence excitation efficiency. Hence, also compounds located in vacuoles at the side of chloroplasts may provide light protection, albeit with a lower efficiency than compounds in epidermal vacuoles. Strong light scattering within leaves may one of the mechanisms by which this is achieved.\nWhen leaves with reduced chlorophyll contents are investigated, fluorescence excitation ratios can be affected as already highlighted above. This is especially obvious with fluorescence excitation in the green absorption gap of chlorophyll, but may at further reduced chlorophyll contents also affect UV excitation ratios. Since human vision is especially sensitive in the green spectral region, where anthocyanins have their absorption maximum, human eyes are well equipped to detect anthocyanins in leaves. Hence, if an instrument is indicating the presence of anthocyanins in leaves, which are obviously greenish, further checks of plausibility are strongly recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAphalo, Pedro José. 1991. “Interactions in Stomatal Function.” PhD thesis, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh; University of Edinburgh. http://hdl.handle.net/1842/14758.\n\n\nBarnes, Paul W, Stephan D Flint, James R Slusser, Wei Gao, and Ronald J Ryel. 2008. “Diurnal Changes in Epidermal UV Transmittance of Plants in Naturally High UV Environments.” Physiologia Plantarum 133: 363–72. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3054.2008.01084.x.\n\n\nBilger, W., T.

    "text": "8.1 Action and response spectra\nPlants do not respond equally to all wavelengths of , and this spectral response can be described by a response spectrum and/or by an action spectrum. It is important to be aware that an action spectrum is not the same thing as a response spectrum. Although they are both used to describe the wavelength dependency of a biological response to radiation they are measured and used differently. Because they are measured in different ways they yield curves of different shapes. A response spectrum shows the size of the response at a fixed photon fluence1 of radiation across a series of different wavelengths. However, since UV radiation never comes at fixed irradiances over the entire spectrum the response spectrum is of limited use when estimating the physiological response to solar- or broadband UV exposure. In contrast, an action spectrum shows the effectiveness of radiation of different wavelengths in achieving a given size of response. This is a very important difference because dose response curves are not necessarily parallel or linear.\nWhen estimating biologically effective irradiances (see section [sec:BSWFs:UVeff] on page ) it is very important to use appropriate action spectra for each biological process. However, since the action spectra of many biological responses are not known, this provides a dilemma for researchers who must try to chose the action spectrum that best approximates the process they are studying. Using the wrong action spectrum can produce very large errors when predicting effective irradiance and, therefore, UV effects on plants due to e.g. ozone depletion (Rundel 1983; Cullen and Neale 1997). This is also a good reason for continued efforts to measure action spectra.\nBuilding a response spectrum is fairly simple; we need to measure a plant response at a single (photon) irradiance (or fluence) for each wavelength (or narrow band), whereas for constructing an action spectrum ones needs to measure the response at several different photon fluence values for each wavelength of interest.",

It is also possible to build, for example, an UV action spectrum with background irradiation of other wavelengths such us PAR.\nShropshire (1972) describes in detail the theory behind monochromatic action spectra, and the assumptions needed for an action spectrum to match the absorption spectrum of a photoreceptor pigment. He also considers the problem of how screening by other or the same pigments can distort the shape of action spectra. He gives examples for visible radiation but the theoretical considerations are fully applicable to ultraviolet radiation.\nTo construct a true action spectrum we first need to measure dose response curves for radiation of different wavelengths (Figure [fig:construct:action:spectrum]). The more curves we measure and the narrower the wavelength range used for each of these, the more spectral detail will be visible in the action spectrum built from them. For each of these curves, we should use a range of photon fluences yielding response sizes going from relatively small responses to close to the maximum response size (close to saturation). The photon fluence values used should increase exponentially. Photon fluence can be varied both by varying irradiance and/or irradiation times. If irradiation time is varied, it should be checked that reciprocity holds2. We fit a curve to each set of dose response data, using the logarithm of the photon fluence as an independent variable. Using a logarithmic scale is expected to yield a more linear response curve than untransformed photon fluence values. From the fitted dose-response curves we calculate by interpolation the photon fluence required at each measured wavelength to obtain a response of the selected target response size. We use the photon fluence values to calculate effectiveness as 1/ ({Q_{\\mathrm{}}}\\cdot t) where fluence is given by the product of photon irradiance () by the irradiation time (t), and we finally plot these effectiveness values against wavelength (\\lambda). If the dose response curves are not parallel, the shape of the action spectrum will depend on the target response level chosen. Different causes have been suggested for the lack of parallelism of dose response curves that is sometimes observed. Two of these suggestions are self-screening effects and involvement of two or more interacting pigments in the response (Shropshire 1972). One can in principle use either quantum (=photon) or energy units, but quantum units are preferable as for any photochemical reaction absorption events always involve quanta. The shape of the spectrum will depend on whether an energy or photon basis is used.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nAs the main feature of interest is the shape of the curve, UV action spectra are usually normalized to an action that is equal to one at 300 nm. This is achieved, by dividing all the quantum (or photon) effectiveness values measured at different wavelengths, by the effectiveness at 300 nm. The use of \\lambda =300 nm is an arbitrary convention, of rather recent adoption, so you will find, especially in the older literature, other wavelengths used for the normalization.\nA response spectrum will rarely match the absorption spectrum of the photoreceptor because of non-linearities in later steps between light absorption by the photoreceptor and an observed response. In the case of action spectra, by keeping the size of the response constant across wavelengths we attempt to minimize the effect of these non-linearities on the measured spectrum. Because of this, a properly measured action spectrum will usually closely follow the absorption spectrum of the pigment acting as photoreceptor, except from possible effect from interfering pigments. Figure [fig:action:spectra] and Table [tab:action:spectra] show several action spectra relevant to research on the effects of UV on plants. See the article by Gorton (2010) for a deeper discussion on biological action spectra.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Constructing a polychromatic action spectrum\nMonochromatic action spectra are useful to understand the nature of a specific response, e.g. damage, but are not suitable for calculating real effects under solar radiation. The response of a plant to light and UV radiation depends on both the amount of energy (dose-response) and the spectral composition of the radiation. Polychromatic action spectroscopy is based on a background of broad-band white light from artificial sources or natural daylight supplemented by various wavelength, for example between 280 and 360 nm (Holmes 1997). This polychromatic approach provides an action spectrum useful for assessing effects of UV under normal plant growing conditions, because the simultaneous exposure to a broad wavelength interval has a different net effect than that of an exposure to separate monochromatic radiation, due to synergisms or antagonisms between complex chemical and biological processes, for example repair mechanisms (Coohill 1992; Madronich 1993). In practice, such a realistic polychromatic radiation spectrum is achieved using a series of cut-off filters, which cut off radiation of wavelengths shorter or longer than a certain wavelength. The effect of such filters can be compared to the effect of the variable thickness of the stratospheric ozone layer. Figure [fig:Poly:Spectra] shows examples of spectral irradiance for broad band light from lamps filtered by different cut-off filters. The cut-off wavelength usually refers to the wavelength of 50% transmission.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nThe original approach, so called differential polychromatic action spectroscopy, is described by Rundel (1983). Different biological responses are proportional to different specific treatments, for example exposures. Thus, an action spectrum can be estimated by quantifying differences in responses between successive treatments. The number of treatments required depends on the relative change in response over a wavelength interval. One example of a quantifiable effect would be change in the observed concentrations of flavonols.\n\n8.1.2.1 The mathematics behind polychromatic action spectra\nThe average proportionality \\overline{s} between differences in the biological effective response of successive treatments i, \\Delta W_{be,i}, and differences in exposure (fluence rate multiplied by exposure time), \\Delta{H_{\\mathrm{i}}} is given by an average quantity \\overline{s_i} = \\frac{\\Delta W_{be,i}}{\\Delta{H_{\\mathrm{i}}}} All the values of \\overline{s_i} together are represented in the action spectrum. If the wavebands of each treatment are small enough, an action spectrum s(\\lambda) can be expressed by a mathematical function. Different functions are discussed (Rundel 1983; Cullen and Neale 1997). In the simplest case the factors \\overline{s_i} are positive and decrease exponentially with increasing wavelength. Thus, one common form of s(\\lambda) is s(\\lambda) = \\mathrm{e}^{-k(\\lambda-\\lambda_0)} \\label{Equ:BSWF:exp} where k is a parameter, which has to be obtained for each different biological effect using a fitting procedure, and a wavelength \\lambda_0, where the action spectra are normalised to unity, e.g. \\lambda_0=300 nm. Other functions including a polynomial dependence on \\lambda are also possible and perhaps necessary for describing complex mechanisms.\nFor the interpretation of the experimental data, the biological effective response W_{be}, it is necessary to consider the wavelength dependency. Thus, it is crucial that the entire spectral irradiance {E_{\\mathrm{}}}(\\lambda,t) during the experiment is known. Broad-band meters are not suitable in most cases. This dependency is included in the biological effective dose function (exposure) {H_{\\mathrm{be}}}, given by\n\\begin{aligned}\n{H_{\\mathrm{be}}} & = & \\int_\\lambda \\int_t \\enspace s(\\lambda) \\cdot {E_{\\mathrm{}}}(\\lambda,t) \\enspace{\\rm d}t\\enspace{\\rm d}\\lambda \\nonumber \\\\\n& = & \\int_\\lambda \\enspace s(\\lambda) \\cdot {H_{\\mathrm{}}}(\\lambda) \\enspace{\\rm d}\\lambda \\label{Equ:Dose:be}\n\\end{aligned} A mathematical model can separate wavelength and dose dependency for a set of experimental data by the use of mathematical functions describing W_{be}({H_{\\mathrm{be}}}) and optimisation procedures, e.g. non-linear curve fitting (Cullen and Neale 1997; Ghetti et al. 1999; Ibdah et al. 2002; Götz et al. 2010). The model assumes that photons at different wavelengths act independently, but with different quantum efficiency at the same absorption site, and therefore with the same mechanism. Regarding the shape and saturation of the observed effect, different functions can describe the data of W_{be}(H_{be}), for example a linear, hyperbolic or sigmoid function. A simple linear relation is W_{be}({H_{\\mathrm{be}}}) = W_0 \\cdot {H_{\\mathrm{be}}} \\label{Equ:Response:lin} with the parameter W_0, which has to be determined by the fitting procedure. If for example the exposure time of the radiation is constant and, therefore, not depending on the duration of the experiment t, the combination of Eqs. [Equ:BSWF:exp] to [Equ:Response:lin] yields W_{be}({H_{\\mathrm{be}}}) = W_0 \\cdot t \\cdot \\int_\\lambda \\enspace \\mathrm{e}^{-k(\\lambda-\\lambda_0)} \\cdot {E_{\\mathrm{}}}(\\lambda) \\enspace{\\rm d}\\lambda \\label{Equ:Response:lin2} To solve the equation for the unknown parameters W_0 and k, measurements of the biological response W_{be} and the spectral irradiance {E_{\\mathrm{}}}(\\lambda,t) have to be put into a fitting routine, to optimise W_0 and k by minimising the differences, e.g. the (root) mean square, between measured and modelled values of W_{be}. In Figure [fig:Poly:Spectra] are six different scenarios shown. In this case, the differences among six individual measured and modelled responses have to be calculated and the sum of these needs to be minimised by a non-linear optimisation technique, such as that provided by the add-in “Solver” in Excel.\n\n\n\n8.1.3 Action spectra in the field\nUnder field conditions it is more difficult to build UV action spectra, and most frequently what are measured are polychromatic action spectra (e.g. Keiller, Mackerness, and Holmes 2003; Cooley et al. 2000).\nAs many whole-plant responses result from a long signal transduction chain, which depends on the action of more than one photoreceptor, the action spectrum for many responses at the whole-plant or organ level, seems to vary among species, with the seasons of the year or growing conditions. For responses like these it is almost impossible to define a unique and stable action spectrum for plants growing outdoors, as these responses are too far decoupled from the photoreceptors.\nEven if they do not faithfully reflect the properties of a single photoreceptor, action spectra can be extremely useful, as we need them as BSWFs (BSWFs) when calculating biologically effective UV doses (see section [sec:BSWFs:UVeff] on page ), since the same UV radiation spectrum has a different effect on different plant responses (Figure [fig:action:spectra]).",

    "section": "8.3 Appendix: Calculation of polychromatic action spectra with Excel (using add-in “Solver”)",
    "text": "8.3 Appendix: Calculation of polychromatic action spectra with Excel (using add-in “Solver”)\nThis is an example of one possibility to derive the parameters of a polychromatic action spectrum by non-linear optimisation as explained in section 1.8.2 on page . The Excel add-in “Solver” is listed in the menu “Tools”. If this is not the case, it has to be installed in Tools&gt;Add-Ins. This experiment was performed in the small sun simulator of the Helmholtz Zentrum München, Neuherberg, Germany (see section [sec:simulators] at page ) in a special cuvette, which allows simultaneous exposure of plants under different radiation (Ibdah et al. 2002; Götz et al. 2010). Figure [fig:Sosi:Cuvette] shows the cuvette placed in the sun simulator with five rows of glass filters from Schott, Mainz, Germany (WG295, WG305, WG320, WG335, WG360).\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nAt the beginning we have to put all our measured data into different sheets in Excel. In this example, the biological response W_{be} is the -induced flavonoid lutonarin (in \\mumol g^{-1} FW (fresh weight)) of the first leaf of the barley cultivar “Barke”. The amount was estimated by HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography). Three young plants in each of three independent experiments were harvested under six different scenarios, which spectral irradiances are shown in figure [fig:Poly:Spectra] in section 1.8.2 on page . The data are put into the first sheet “leaf data” and mean values and standard deviations for each scenario were calculated as illustrated in figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet1]).\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nThe second sheet “spectra” contains all measured spectra of the six different scenarios under the glass filters. For the calculation of a polychromatic action spectrum in the range it is recommended that the spectrum is measured using a double-monochromator system from 280 to 400 nm in steps of 1 nm. In this experiment, the irradiance was increased from the morning until noon and then decreased until the evening, to simulate natural variation in solar radiation. This was done in four steps as shown in the picture of the third sheet “daily exposure” in figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet3]. As an example, typical radiation data under the glass filter WG305, measured during the experiment, are presented in table [tab:App:Poly:Spectra:UV-PAR]. This sheet is only necessary to calculate the exposure time at each light level in seconds as shown in the marked cell F8. Sheet “spectra” contains the wavelengths in column A and all the 24 spectra (six scenarios and four light levels) from column B to Y.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLight level\n1\n2\n3\n4\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n\n0.152\n0.584\n1.135\n1.531\nW m^{-2}\n\n\n\n8.76\n19.78\n24.67\n38.74\nW m^{-2}\n\n\n\n114\n228\n256\n363\nW m^{-2}\n\n\nor\n537\n1073\n1198\n1692\n\\mumol m^{-2} s^{-1}\n\n\n\n\n\nNow all sheets for input data are finished and the sheets for solving our system of equations has to be prepared. Therefore, the next sheet “weighted spectra” is filled with the information about the action spectrum function as shown in figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet4]. This sheet contains the calculation of the biological effective dose function H_{be} as presented in equation [Equ:Dose:be] on page . First, for the action spectrum s(\\lambda) an exponential function in chosen, as explained for equation [Equ:BSWF:exp] on page . Column A includes the wavelengths and column B the estimated value of the action spectrum using the parameter \\lambda_0=300 nm of cell B4 and k=0.200 nm^{-1} of cell B5 (marked red in figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet4]). This cell is only a link to cell B11 in the next sheet “SOLVER”. Because it is only the starting value of the optimisation procedure, the values of column B do not represent the real action spectrum. These values will change during optimisation. Below row 6, column D and the following columns (in this case to column AA) include the values of the action spectrum of column B multiplied by the spectral irradiances of each scenario and light levels of sheet “spectra”. Row 1 and 2 include the estimation of the doses. The cells in row 2 from column D and the following columns represent the integration over the wavelengths from 280 to 400 nm of each column beneath multiplied by the exposure time of the respective scenario and light level as previously calculated in the sheet “daily exposure”. Integration in Excel is done by adding the values of the cells regarding the wavelength step as shown for the marked cell D2 in figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet4]. Here it is 1 nm. To get doses in units of Ws m^{-2} (J m^{-2}), the sum is divided by a factor of 1000 because the spectral irradiances were measured in mW m^{-2} nm^{-1}. The daily dose (in kJ m^{-2}) is then calculated in row 1 for each scenario by adding the four values of the light levels. These daily doses are now needed for further calculations in the next sheet “SOLVER”.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nThe sheet “SOLVER” as illustrated in figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solver0] includes the comparison of the measured and modelled data—as table and figure. The first five rows are a short explanation of the entire model. Especially row 5 contains the mathematical function describing the measured biological response W_{be}, which was the flavonoid content of lutonarin in the first leaf of barley. Here, a sigmoid function was chosen, given by W_{be} = \\frac{W_0}{1+\\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{{H_{\\mathrm{be}}}-{H_{\\mathrm{0}}}}{b}}} \\label{Equ:Response:sigmoid} Using this function, the values of each scenario of row 15 were calculated. Therefore, the variable coefficients W_0, {H_{\\mathrm{0}}}, b, and k as well as their constraints from row 8 to 11 were used. Row 14 includes the mean values of each treatment derived in the first sheet “leaf data”. The squared differences of measured and modelled data are calculated in row 16 and added up in cell C17. All cells are now prepared and we can start to optimise our variable coefficients by minimising the value of cell C17. Thus, we mark this cell by clicking on it and choose from the menu Tools&gt;Solver. A new small window called “Solver Parameters” will appear as shown in the left part of figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solverparam]. Here, the target cell was C17 and the box for minimisation was checked. The optimisation was done by changing the cells B8 to B11 concerning all constraints listed in the sheet. By clicking on the button “Options”, another window will pop up, where the parameters for the optimisation algorithm are defined (right part of figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solverparam]). In this example, a non-linear Newton method was used. The parameters of the upper left part of the window define the number of iterations or the maximum time for calculation as well as the precision or tolerance of the result. After inserting the numbers and checking the necessary boxes, click “OK” to return to the window “Solver Parameters”. Here, the optimisation starts by clicking on “Solve”. After a while, the program returns a message if the search succeeded and by accepting, the result is written into the cells of sheet “SOLVER” chosen for changing.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nThe final result for the data in this example is shown in figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solved]. The sum of the squared differences was minimised to 0.13. The left graph in the bottom of figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solved] shows two bars for each scenario, one for the measured leaf data of row 14 (yellow) and the other one for the modelled data of row 15 (purple). The result looks promising. The most important parameter regarding the action spectrum is k=0.126 nm^{-1} in cell B11. This value was used to plot the actual action spectrum of this study in the upper right graph of figure [fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solved]. Our action spectrum is valid for wavelengths between 280 and 400 nm, that interval which was chosen for integration in sheet “weighted spectra”.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nThis example describes just one possibility to solve a multi-variable and non-linear problem. For example, there is also a plugin available for Calc in OpenOffice.org. Therefore, if using Calc instead of Excel, the file NLPSolver.oxt3 has to be installed by the extension manager. Other search algorithms are used in this tool, but the result will be the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBjörn, Lars Olof, ed. 2007. Photobiology: The Science of Life and Light. 2nd ed.

When producing colour images image sensors with three channels are used, with sensors with designed to mimic the spectral sensitivity of the three photoreceptors participating in human day-time vision. This also applies to colour films (and video, TV and colour printing). In the case of greyscale (= black and white, BW) photographic films and very few digital cameras the images produced aim at reproducing the brightness of an scene as seen by humans. In other words, photograpoc cameras are designed to work as proxies for human vision.\nCameras used in industrial automation (= “machine vision”), astronomy, microscopy, etc., frequently use the same of similar image sensors as photography cameras, but exceptions are more common. Momochrome cameras are abundant and NIR cameras rather abundant. Cameras for UV are available and exceptionally, cameras for UV-B and even UV-C. Thermal IR cameras, designed for temperature measurements are monochromatic and sensitive to radiation in the range 8\\,\\mu m to 14\\,\\mu m (for -20^\\circ\\mathrm{C} to 1500^\\circ\\mathrm{C}), 0.85\\,\\mu m to 1.1\\,\\mu m (for 450^\\circ\\mathrm{C} to 1800^\\circ\\mathrm{C}, used for hot metal), and other variants.\nSpectral cameras cover the VIS wavelength range with more than three “colour” channels. Hyperspectral cameras frequently cover a wider range of wavelengths and have high wavelength resolution, i.e., they measure a spectrum for each pixel in the acquired image. Most of the these cameras cover the VIS and/or NIR but not UV.\nWith static subjects it is possible to acquire the images for the different wavelengths sequentially, even using black and white film or a monochromatic digital camera. This is how some early colour photography techniques were implemented using band-pass filters under sunlight or white light, and persisted mainly in reproduction work. Alternatively, in a darkened space, light of different colour can be used for illumination to the same effect.",

In addition to colour cameras, monochrome cameras are also available. Some of the cameras used for machine vision and research are capable of capturing images at a very fast rate. Other cameras, such as those used for astronomy, have low noise sensors, sometimes with active cooling, that can work with very low light levels. Many, but not all, of these cameras are expensive and ment to be used thetered to a computer or at least with a separate screen, lacking a built-in screen and having few built-in controls. Some are intended to be mounted at a fixed position or at least on a tripod while others are suityable for use in drones. In most cases these cameras produce live images, can be fully controlled remotely either by wire (ethernet or USB) or wirelessly (Wifi).\nThere are also cheap cameras sold for use with microcontrollers or single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi and Arduino that are available in two versions with and without a NIR-blocking filter. The cameras use sensors similar or even identical to those in smart phones. These cameras can be used only thetered to one of these boards. The connection to the boards is by wire and only at very short distances. Remote and local access is through the controller board. More recently very small boards based on ESP32 microcontrollers have become available with built-in cameras and able to connect through wireless prococols like Wifi, Bluetooth and Matter. The image sensors used in these cheap cameras even if in same cases have high pixels resolution are small, and rarely good for use in low light conditions.\n\n\n9.1.2 Digital photography cameras\nThe cameras sold for photography are self contained: all controls, viewfinder and/or live-view screen, image review and image data storage all take place in-camera, and cameras are battery powered. Most cameras for ordinary photography are designed for imaging reflected visible light. In a few cases, manufacturers have offered versions of these cameras for use in forensics, with extended wavelength range. The sensors used are natively sensitive to shorter and longer wavelengths but optical filters attached to them limit the wavelngth range. Depending on the camera the shortest wavelengths that are detected vary between 380 nm and 410 nm, and the longest ones between 680 nm and 730 nm. The filters used are usually absoptive ionic and the cut-in and cut-off, specialy at the NIR end, are gradual, i.e., it is possible to use a 720 nm long-pass filter in most cameras but only by increasing exposure by orders of magnitude. Most of these cameras have colour sensors with red, green and blue filters on individual pixels. Currently, there are three monochromatic (or greyscale) system cameras in this group: Leica xxx, Pentax xxxx and xxxx.\nIt is possible to convert cameras to “full spectrum” (meaning the native sensitivity of the sensor) or alternatively a to especific range of wavelengths by replacing the filter that is built onto the image sensor. For a “full spectrum” conversion quartz or a long-pass filter with cut-in at 280 nm is used as replacement. This type of conversion involves disassembling the camera but is rather simple, and costs between 200 € and 500 € depending on the camera model and who does the conversion. The inherent sensitivity of image sensors is lower in the UV than in VIS, but at the NIR end it remains high up to 800 nm or longer.\nIn a “full spectrum” conversion, the sensor itself in not modified, and the RGB filters remain on the sensors pixels. Several companies, both is the USA and in Europe offer conversions, but not all are equally reliable. The conversion of a colour camera into a monochrome camera is much more difficult and exists a risk of damaging the sensor making it unusable, as it involves the removal filters that are part of the sensor. Very few companies do this type of conversion, charging from 1200 € to &gt; 1500 €, usually only accepting for conversion specific models or brands of cameras. Removing the filters enhances light sensitivity and image effective resolution. A full “full spectrum monochrome” conversion is also possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse colour in UV-A and NIR\n\n\n\nIn a full-spectrum-converted camera the RGB filters on the sensor array remain. These filters also differ in their transmittance for wavelengths in the UV-A and NIR regions, thus, in UV-A and NIR the RGB channels in the sensor respond differently to different wavelengths, even in the absence of red, green and blue light. When the data are “interpreted” by the software (raw converter) as for visible light a false-colour image results. Depending on the case the false colour can be informative or a nuisance. If found a nuisance or confusing the image can be converted from colour into greyscale based on the three channels or by extracting the data for an individual channel.\n\n\nA camera converted to “full-spectrum” is sensitive to an extended range of wavelengths of approximately 340 nm to 1000 nm. This range can be constrained by means of optical filters attached either in front or behind the lens. Thus, a “full-spectrum” converted camera can be used for UV-A, VIS or NIR photography by swapping filters. Having a camera sensitive to a wider range of wavelengths is only one requirement, an objective (= lens) that transmits and performs well in the UV and NIR regions is also needed.\n\n\n9.1.3 Spectral and hyperspectral cameras",

    "text": "9.2 Objectives\nFor an objective to be suitable for UV or NIR photography it has to have reasonably high transmittance of the wavelengths we intend to capture in the image and it has be corrected for image aberrations and other problems at these same wavelengths. There exist very few camera objectives that can transmit and are corrected for UV, and those that exist are extremely expensive (&gt; 10,000 €) and fragile. I will not discuss such objectives further, instead, I will discuss the cheaper alternative of using normal objectives. Three main difficulties are usually encountered when attempting: low transmittance, ghosting and other reflections, and aberrations than decrease image resolution.\n\nMost photography objectives have high transmittance in the NIR region. Incontrast, most modern, and many vintage, objectives have very low transmittance in the UV region. The reason for this is in the glass used, its thickness, the cemment used to assemble lens groups and the properties of the antireflection coatings used. A general “wisdom” not free of exceptions is that the more elements (more surfaces with coatings) and the thicker these glass elements are, the less likely an objective is to have good UV transmission. This usually means that simpler designs and slower (smaller maximum apperture) objective are more likely to transmit some UV-A radiation. Older or “vintage” objectives had simpler designs and less effective coatings and as a result very few modern objectives have high UV-A transmittance, and the exceptions are a few cheap modern objectives. In general, accidental UV objectives are “prime lenses” (fixed-focal-length objectives) not zooms or extreme wide-angle. It is usual to describe objectives that are not designed for use in UV, but happen to work reasonably well as “accidental” UV-capable objectives.\nTo prevent reflections non-glass surfaces of the “barrel” of the objective and the edges of glass (or plastic) optical elements are painted or treated black. The shape of the surfaces inside the objective in most cases are also designed to reduce reflections. Coatings that have very high absorptance in the VIS region not necessarily have the same property outside the VIS region. One rather extreme case is black-annodized aluminium which is highly reflective in the NIR region. Many photography lenses produce images with hot spots (usually the center of the image) when used in NIR. In most cases this problem is more noticeable at specific appertures. Frequently, ghosting caused by specular reflections is visible in images as bright spots with the shape of the diaphrogm apperture (opening or “hole”). Flare, caused by scattered radiation or diffuse reflection results is a lowering of image contrast. Although there are many more objectives suitable for NIR photography than for UV-A photography, it is important to keep in mind that some objectives produce better images than others.\nChromatic aberrations appear when the path of light of different wavelengths through a lens differs. For example, when a white object is photographed, the red, green and blue components can be slighly displace from each other when projected on the sensor or film. In digital photographs chromatic aberretation are visible in high contrast edges as coloured halos. Most photography objectives are corrected for these aberrations by design only in the VIS range, outside this range how objectives behave is an “accident”. Given the nature of the aberrations the narrower the range of wavelengths captured, the less likely it is they will affect an image.\n\nThe design of any objective is a compromise among multiple criteria, related not only to image quality, but also usability, size, weight and cost of manufacture. The design of different objectives is based on a different compromise. In spite of this, some objectives happen to work reasonably well outside the range of wavelengths for which their design was optimized. They never match the performance of objectives designed for UV photography, which can the used all the way to 250 nm or even shorter wavelengths. However, these extremely expensive and fragile are overkill when the sensitivity of the sensor of a camera is only sensitive to \\lambda &gt; 330\\ldots350 nm.\nFinding a good accidental UV objective is made easier by lists published on the internet. Similar lists exist for objectives that do not free of hot-spot problems. These lists are in many cases bases on tests using different criteria and methods. They serve only as an indication, but provide no guarantee. In addition, many now vintage lenses were manufactured during several decades, with occasional changes in antireflection coatings or other alterations that can affect UV transmittance. There are also a couple of modern objects, manufactured until recently, that do trnsmit UV-A1 and even support autofocus in UV (when there is strong light).\nIn the case of hot spots under NIR, the assessments on which the lists are based are even more subjective as they are usually based on visual assessment of images. In the case of NIR many modern as well as old objectives can be used at least at some appertures. When using vintage objectives on modern cameras one needs to rely on adapter rings, and when using non-macro objectives for macro photography, extenssion tubes are inserted between the objective and the camera. Quite frequenty one can find statements that such tubes without any glass cannot degrade objective performance. This is far from true, and frequently a problem, especially for NIR photography. Many cheap adapters and extenssion tubes are made of aluminium blacked by anodization and are internally highly reflective to NIR radiation and less so to VIS light, but enough to degrade the quality of images not only in NIR. It is common that the inside is ribbed perpendiculalry to the axis of the objective. This helps reduce especular reflections, and when combined with a non-reflecting black paint, very effective. If the ribbed surface is reflective, light is scattered and glare affects the image. These are not the only problems low quality adapters and tubes can introduce. If the dimensions of the mounts and especially the length of adapters is wrong, focusing at infinity can become impossible. This effect is most noticeable with wide angle objectives, e.g., for a fisheye objective with a focal length of 4.5 mm, the required accuracy in the adapter is a small fraction of a millimetre. It is important to be aware of these possible problems. It is also possible to paint the interior wall of extension tubes and adapter oneself if the manufacturer has not done so. The choice of paint is important as only some special paints absorb 95% or more of NIR.",

    "text": "9.3 Optical filters\nOptical filters select wavelengths through absortion and/or through reflection. Each type has its limitations and benefits, both in performance and cost.\nAbsorptive glass filters are based on “ionic” glass, i.e., glasses including different ions in their composition. Some of the ions tradditionaly used are metals like iron, lead, copper and chrome. As with any material absorbing photons, fluorescence is one of the possible energy dissipation mechanisms. Thus, some of these filters, e.g., when illuminated with UV-A radiation emit fluorescence in the visible range, and other emit NIR fluorescence when illuminated with blue light. The absorptance depends on their thickness as the glass as a whole has uniform properties across its depth. The change in the absorptance spectrum with the angle of light incidence is moderate. Their cut-offs and cut-ins are gradual, and they exist as band-pass, short-pass and long-pass filters. From the perspective of their use, as the transmitted bands are broad, the distinction between short-pass and band-pass gets blured, i.e., most UV-A and UV-B “short-pass” filters do block UV-C and/or shorter wavelengths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilters can deteriorate\n\n\n\nSome types of ionic glass filters have high concentrations of metal salts in their composition and their surface can “corrode” in contact with humid air. If they have antireflection, or other coatings or thin layers deposited on their surface they tend be well protected. Those, with no coatings, can need especially in wet climates to be polished using fime cerium oxide paste or restored chemically. The recommendation is to store filters in a dry place and to regularly inspect the condition of their surface.\nThe spectral transmittance of both clear plastic and glass can change on exposure to strong light, specially blue and shorter wavelengths. In the case of plastics, not only cellulose acetate is affected. Of glasses, those containing iron, usually as an impurity, are the most prone to “yellowing” through “solarization”.\n\n\nPlastic filters are sometimes used, specially at large sizes like 50 \\times 50 mm squares, as they are cheaper. They can be easily damaged in ways that can affect the quality of images, and need to be handled carefully. On the other, small scratches are irrelevant when filters are used on light sources, but it is necessary to protect them from excessive heat.\nUntil approximately 50 years ago gelatine filters were common. Obviously a thin layer of dry coloured gelatine is extremely fragile, but because they are so thin affect an optical system much less than thicker filters. They are still used, especially for filters located between the back of a lens and the sensor or film. When a thicker glass filter is located between sensor or film and objective, the focus point shifts, in extreme cases restricting the focusing range of the objective.\nThere is an additional type of absorptive filters, formely very common in photography: a thin light-absorbing layer of coloured gelatine encased between two layers of optical glass. As far as I know, only Tiffen still makes this type of filter.\nInterference filters work by reflection from surface multilayer thin coatings. As with reflection in general, reflectance by the thin layers is affected by the light incidence angle. In this type of filters the cut-off and cut-in wavelengths shift significantly at shallow light incidence angles compared to normal incidence. Their main advantage is that they can be designed to have very sharp cut-ind and cut-offs, can have multiple discontinuous trtansmission bands and very strong blocking of off-band radiation. They are available with transmitted bands as narrow as a couple of nm to 100’s of nanometres. However´, only the best and most expensive interference filters achieve such high performance. The better filters have more thin-layers with more accurate thickness, which increases the fabrication cost. As they are usually deposited on optical-grade quartz as subtrate, the thikness of the substrate of these filters has little if any affect on their spectral properties. The thin films are fragile, so some of these filters have a hard-coating added at their surface for protection. In spite of working by reflection, which face of the filter points to the light source does not significantly affect their spectral transmittance.\nSome of the best VIS-blocking UV-pass filters for photography and astronomy (“Venus filters”) are interference filters with VIS-absorbing ionic glass as substrate. Some of them, even have different interference filters deposited on each of their faces. Some photographers argue that which face of these filters faces the sensor can affect reflections within the camera resulting slightly different amounts of glare. Of the common filters used in VIS photography, only some UV-blocking and all UV + NIR blocking filters are interference filters, most other filters are absprptive.\nEach glass-air interface reflects approximately 4.5% of the light traversing it as result of the difference in refractive index (n). Modern lenses and good photographic filters are anti-reflection multicoated, and the best ones reflect &lt; 0.1\\% of the light impinging on their surface. These coatings are similar in principle to interference filters, they change n at the surface. However, thet are designed to minimize reflections across a given range of wavelengths instead of increeasing them. In recent year a further additional coating applied to outer lens surfaces and filters, a fluorine compound coating that alters surface properties so that water runs off the surface and dirt does not stick. Antireflection coating do modify the spectral transmittance, increasing it in the target range of wavelengths but frequently decreasing it in other regions of the spectrum.",

    "text": "9.4 UV, VIS and NIR radiation sources\nDaylight is a strong source of UV-A radiation when the elevation of the sun is more than 30 or 40 degrees above the horizon. The irradiance of NIR compared to VIS in daylight varies less than that of UV. As described in Chapter XX, the scattering of sunlight in the atmosphere is more at shorter than at longer wavelengths. Lanscapes look very different in a UV and in a NIR image. The proportion of UV-A in the shade can be rather high but the low irradiance makes very long exposures necessary.\nXenon flash lamps emit as much or more UV-A radiation than VIS light, but those sold for photography are in most cases filtered so as to block all UV to make their use safer and to avoid a blue cast in photographs. As Xenon flash lamps emit across the whole UV-A, UV-B and UV-C region (although filter for protection), similarly to sunlight, produce false-colour UV images.\nLEDs with peaks of emission between 365 nm and 415 nm do emit UV-A and are cheap and readily available. However, because of their rather narrow peaks of emission create nearly monochromatic images, with little false colour. One possibility is to use and array with a mix of LEDs emitting at different but partly overlapping wavelengths.\nIn the case of NIR all three sources are effective: sunlight, Xenon flash and LEDs. LEDs with their narrow peaks of emission unless combined, fail to produce strong false colour effects.",

An off-the-shelf camera is the best tool unless NIR fluorescence is of interest.\nObjective: Most lenses work well but given the very low light levels a lens with an f/2.8 apperture or wider is preferable.\nLight source: A 365 nm LED-based flashlight works well if of enough power (&gt;= 3 W for a 0.25 m to 2.0 m range and static subjects), preferably with a Nichia LED and an VIS-blocking filter such as 3 mm or 2 mm-thick SWB2 filter. The induced fluorescence is weak so that if any visible light emitted by the UV source can go through both filters, it will show in the photographs.\n\n\n\nCode\nautoplot(smooth_spct(lamps.mspct[c(\"Convoy.S2plus.LED.UVA.flashlight\")], \n                     method = \"supsmu\", strength = 0.001),\n         range = c(315, 450))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn-camera filter: A high-quality UV-blocking filter is needed. Most UV-filters sold for photography have a cut-in at too short wavelengths (330 to 380 nm). However, when using a 365 nm LED as light source the filter used on the lens has to block wavelengths just past 400 nm. The best, but rather expensive, option is a Zeiss UV T* filter, second best is a significantly cheaper Firecrest UV400 filter (from Formatt-Hitech, apparently gone bankrupt), and a third option is a Tiffen Haze 2A filter (rather difficult to find outside USA). The first two are interference filters and reflect UV, rather than absorb it. The Tiffen filter, a rather old type in the tradition of Kodak Wratten filters, has a thin UV-absorbing gelatine layer encased between two glass sheets. None of these three filters fluoresce significantly when exposed to UV radiation. Most yellow, orange and red filters are made of ionic glass and when illuminated with UV fluoresce strongly. They can be used only behind a UV-absorbing filter. NIR pass filters are also ionic and do also fluoresce, but less intensively (I am not sure of which wavelengths induce the strongest fluorescence in NIR filters, but likely from the VIS range).\n\n\n\nCode\nautoplot(filters.mspct[c(\"Zeiss_UV_Tstar_2.0mm_52mm\",\n                          \"Hoya_UV0_HMC_2.0mm_52mm\")],\n         range = c(315, 450)) + theme(legend.position = \"top\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n(autoplot(smooth_spct(normalise(lamps.mspct[[\"Convoy.S2plus.LED.UVA.flashlight\"]], norm = \"undo\") *\n                       filters.mspct[[\"Zeiss_UV_Tstar_2.0mm_52mm\"]], method = \"supsmu\", strength = 0.5),\n         range = c(315, 450), ylim = c(NA, 6.2), \n         annotations = c(\"-\", \"peaks\")) + ggtitle(\"Zeiss UV T* filter\") +\n   theme(legend.position = \"top\")) |\n(autoplot(smooth_spct(normalise(lamps.mspct[[\"Convoy.S2plus.LED.UVA.flashlight\"]], norm = \"undo\") *\n                       filters.mspct[[\"Hoya_UV0_HMC_2.0mm_52mm\"]], method = \"supsmu\", strength = 0.5),\n         range = c(315, 450), ylim = c(NA, 6.2), \n         annotations = c(\"-\", \"peaks\")) + ggtitle(\"Hoya UV(0) filter\") + \n   theme(legend.position = \"top\")) + plot_layout(axis_titles = \"collect\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUV-induced fluorescence of filters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport: Exposure times between 20 s and a 2 min are common, so the camera must be mounted so that it cannot move. I normally use a tripod outdoors and a copy stand or a tripod indoors. Many modern camera can be controlled with a phone app, while older ones can be triggered with a cable or radio-remote. If a IR remote is to be used, better test that its light does not show in the photographs.\nLocation, outdoors: The best location is far from any artificial illumination in a moon-less night. How dark it needs to be depends on the length of expossure, so brightly fluorescing subjects like some lichens are more forgiving. At high latitudes, in the late spring and summer, it remains too bright through out the night. The autumun is the best season, especially if one gets a windless night.\nLocation, indoors: Even in a dark room, there are usually items that strongly fluoresce such as light-coloured clothing, white papers and even some plastics. One needs to move such items away and if not possible, set the UV-radiation beam to illuminate the subject but not those items.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTools I use\n\n\n\n\nCamera: mirrorless digital cameras. Since three years ago Olympus OM-1, five years ago an Olympus E-M1 Mk II and about 10 years ago an Olympus E-M1. The OM-1 has a feature that is especially good for very long exposures: it can display the image while it is being captured, even on the screen of a phone or tablet. Used with the shutter in bulb mode one can close the shutter when the image looks bright enough. In addition, one can see live how light painting with the flashlight affects the image.\nObjectives: I have used for many years most frequently a Sigma 30 mm f/1.4, and more recently an M.Zuiko 25 mm f/1.2 in its place. When needing other focal lengths the M.Zuiko 12-40 mm f/2.8 zoom has worked well. After all, one is just photographing VIS light, so almost any lens should work nicely optically.\nOn camera filter: the three mentioned above, interchangeably. Sometimes combined with long-pass filters.\nFlashlight UVA: Convoy 2+ with 365 nm Nichia LED rated at 3 W. I replaced the clear window with a VIS-blocking filter. This flashlight has a narrow and very intense UV beam that works very well for light painting. Jaxman 1aC 365 nm 6W “flood” flashlight has a broader and less intense UV beam. It came already with a VIS-blocking filter installed. The two flashlight are physically very similar but differ in the LED and most significantly the reflector.\nFlashlight, VIS: As I tend to take a paired reference photograph in white light for each fluorescence image, I use a 5W video fill light (SunwayFoto FL96). Many similar lamps are avaialble, but not all of them have a high colour rendition index (CRI). A value of 95 or higher is good for colour reproduction.\nWhite reference slab: A normal colour chart is unsuitable. Some grey cards sold for white balancing can be used but I consider them too expensive to use in the field, especially in the dark. I use instead a piece a white “vigin” (not recycled) PTFE (=Teflon) about 6 mm thick. Pure clean PTFE has similar and very high reflectance in the UV, VIS and NIR, and can be easily washed to clean it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite balancing fluorescence photographs\n\n\n\nObjectively white balancing a photograph of fluorescence is nearly impossible. After trying other approaches I have mostly settled into editing the colour in these photographs to “look right”, i.e., matching my recollection of how the subject looked like when I photographed it. However, in some cases I use just a daylight balance and alternatively edit the colour to remove intense casts so as to increase the apparent colour range.",

    "text": "10.1 Prediction and attribution vs. prediction and estimation\nData analysis can have two different aims prediction and attribution or prediction and estimation. In the first case, we test a hypotheses formulated a priori, assigning a significance to predictors. In the second case, we aim at estimating curves or surfaces that describe a relationship and possibly predict new yet unobserved cases. Traditional statistics are useful in both cases. Newer methods that rely on big data can be called “pure prediction algorithms”, e.g., neural nets, deep learning, random forests, and similar methods. These methods taken broadly are unsuitable for attribution, i.e., for hypothesis testing in scientific research (Efron 2020).\nThe guidelines given here for good experimental design have been formulated with particular consideration given to experiments based on the manipulation of the UV, VIS and NIR radiation environemnt. Nevertheless most of the principles behind these guidelines can be generally applied to the design of experiments.\nExperiments can be designed to test attribution (hypothesis testing), to estimate relationships between explanatory and response variables. In this second case we may be content to estimate the likely value of parameters given a model, or do model selection, estimating not only parameter values and their confidence, but also selecting based on data the formulation of the model.\nIn the case when attribution is the aim, we should be careful not to let our knowledge of the data influence the tested hypothesis[^35]. In the second case, model choice can to some extent depend on the data, but we should be aware that this a posteriori choice of a functional relationship, could make the P-values less strict and thus invalid for assigning attribution.\nFitting models, for attribution or estimation, is especially useful when the parameters of the model have a biological or physical interpretation. In the case of estimation, it is important to also obtain estimates of the reliability of the estimates of the parameters values. In other words, we need to present not only the fitted values, but also their confidence intervals, or at least their standard deviations.\nAll estimates of P-values are based on a comparison of the variation between differently treated experimental units, and the variation among equally treated experimental units[^36]. If we assign treatments objectively by randomization, we can expect that in the absence of a treatment effect, on average, there will not be more variation among differently treated units than between equally treated units. The quality of the estimates obtained for the magnitude of these sources of variation will depend on the number of replicates measured, on proper randomization, and on an adequate design being used to control known error sources. The remaining unaccounted variation among equally treated units is called experimental error.\nWhen using tests of significance one should be aware that the P-value will depend on both the size of the treatment effect and on the standard deviation of the estimate (e.g., standard error of the mean) which strongly depends on the number of replicates. In an experiment with hundreds of replicates one is very likely to detect treatment effects that are statistically-significant, even if these effects are too small to be of any biological significance. On the contrary, in an experiment with few replicates, one risks biologically-significant effects remaining undetected. One should never forget that a large P-value indicates only that we have been unable to demonstrate an effect of a treatment, rather than demonstrating that such an effect did not exist. Strictly speaking it is impossible to demonstrate that there is no effect. However, what we can do is to estimate the size of the smallest effect that our experiment could have detected. This can be done by means of ‘statistical-power analysis’ (see Cohen 1977; Quinn and Keough 2002, chap. 7).\nJohn W. Tukey (1991) has written:",

    "text": "10.2 Planning of experiments\nIt is very important to properly design and plan an experiment in advance of its execution. From a well planned experiment one gets more interpretable and reliable results, usually with less effort and expense, and even sometimes faster. Often, badly planned experiments can yield unreliable data or results that do not answer the intended objective of a study. There are too many examples in the scientific literature of badly designed experiments or invalid statistical analyzes leading to erroneous conclusions, and manuscripts submitted for publication are frequently rejected by journals on the basis of a poorly thought through design.",

    "section": "10.4 Experimental design",
    "text": "10.4 Experimental design\nAs discussed by Cox and Reid (2000), the most basic requirement for a good experiment is that the questions it addresses should be interesting and fruitful. Usually this means examining one or more well-formulated research hypothesis. In most cases the more specific the research question asked, the greater the chance of obtaining a meaningful result. Quoting J. W. Tukey “An approximate answer to the right problem is worth a good deal more than an exact answer to an approximate problem.”\nOnce the research hypothesis to test has been chosen:\n\nthe experimental units must be defined and chosen,\nthe treatments must be clearly defined,\nthe variables to be measured in each unit must be specified, and\nthe size of the experiment, in particular the number of experimental units, has to be decided.\n\nWhen we perform an experiment, we choose our experimental units and manipulate their environment by controlling the levels of a component factor within that environment (treatments). We then record the response of our experimental unit. Factors are groups of different manipulations of a single variable. Each of the distinct manipulations within a factor is called a level: e.g. in an experiment giving plants daily exposures to 0, 5, and 10 of , the factor is and it has three levels (0, 5, and 10 ). A factor can also be qualitative, e.g. a factor where the levels are different chemicals.\nQuestions detailing the steps:\n\nWhat is the purpose of the experiment? To which objective questions do we want to find answers?\nWhat treatment is to be applied? At what levels? Do we include an untreated control? Is there any structure within the treatments?\nWhat is the response to be observed and recorded? What is the nature of the observations?\nAre there other variables which could affect the response?\nHow big a difference in response is practically important? How big a difference in response should be detectable?\nHow many experimental units are appropriate and practical to use?\nHow do we organize the experiment? What, where, when, how, who...?\nHow will the data obtained be analyzed?\n\nIn addition to performing these steps, keep notes in a logbook of the experimental plan, and everything done during the experiment. This will allow you to go back and check if the design was sound and how faithfully it was followed. By noting any changes that were made we may remember something important to assist in the interpretation of the results, or an improvement to make to future experimental designs. If necessary, such notes will also allow for any future repetition of the whole experiment. See examples in Box [ex:stats:UVexp:design].\n\n\n\nPurpose: study the effect of solar radiation on the accumulation of flavonoids in silver birch seedlings.\nResponse observed: concentration of flavonoids in the upper epidermis of the leaf. Nature of observations: epidermal absorbance measured at 365 nm wavelength with a Dualex FLAV instrument. Sequential measurements once a week.\nTreatment: Solar attenuation using filters. Levels 10%, 50%, and 90% attenuation of .\nOther variables which could affect the response: age of seedlings, age and size of sampled leaf, soil type, temperature, rainfall, shading, time of application.\nNumber of experimental units: e.g. 5. Estimated based on item [Example:item:sizeof response] below.\nNumber of seedlings (subsamples) measured in each experimental unit: e.g. 20.\nHow do we organize the experiment? What seed provenance, size of pots, sowing date, fertilization date if any, watering frequency, filter frame size and height, soil used, how frequently to sample and when, who does all these things.\nData analysis: compute the mean epidermal absorbance for each experimental unit and date, and test for differences between treatments in an ANOVA for repeated measurements, accounting for any uncontrolled environmental gradients (as blocks or covariates).\nDifference in response that is practically important from a biological perspective: e.g. 0.3 absorbance units. Detectable difference: e.g. 0.2 absorbance units. []{#Example:item:sizeof response label=“Example:item:sizeof response”}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirements for a good experiment\n\n\n\nFollowing Cox (1958, chap. 1):\n\nPrecision. Random errors of estimation should be suitably small, and this should be achieved with as few experimental units as possible (a sort of cost/benefit analysis).\nAbsence of systematic error. Experimental units receiving different treatments should differ in no systematic way from one another (to avoid bias confounded with effects of interest).\nRange of validity. The conclusions should have as wide a range of validity as needed for the problem under study.\nSimplicity. The experiment should be as simple as possible in design and data analysis.\nAssessment of uncertainty. A proper statistical analysis of the results should be possible without making artificial assumptions. (The fewer and more plausible the assumptions are, the more credible results and conclusions will be.)\n\n\n\nIn practice we almost never have too many replicates in experiments, as the responses under study tend to be small compared to the random variation. For experiments, more frequently the problem at hand is how to make the most efficient use of the limited number of true replicates that we can afford. Good experimental design helps with this and helps us to assess the feasibility of experiments given a limited amount of resources. Fulfilling the requirements listed above will ensure that conclusions derived from experiments are valid.",

    "section": "10.5 The principles of experimental design",
    "text": "10.5 The principles of experimental design\nWe will consider three ‘principles’ on which the design of experiments should be based: replication, randomization, and grouping into blocks. Each of these principles ensures that one aspect of the design of an experiment is correct and increases the likelihood that it will yield data that can be statistically analyzed without need for unrealistic assumptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples of experimental design\n\n\n\n\nReplication \\rightarrow control of random variation \\rightarrow precision.\nRandomisation \\rightarrow elimination of systematic error.\nUse of blocks or covariates \\rightarrow reduction of error variation caused by experimental unit heterogeneity.\n\n\n\nIn the sections below we discuss each of these principles in turn and give examples of their application.\n\n10.5.1 Replication\nWhen an experiment is done several times, either simultaneously or sequentially, each time or repetition is a replicate. Replication serves several very important roles.\n\nReplication allows for estimation of the random variation accompanying the results. This random variation is called experimental error.\nReplication increases the precision with which the treatment effect is estimated, because each repetition gives additional information about the experiment. This can be appreciated from the equation relating the variance of the original population to that of the mean: \\sigma^2_{\\overline{x}} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}, where \\overline{x} is the mean, n the number of replicates, and where \\sigma^2 is the variance (of individual measurements) and \\sigma^2_{\\overline{x}} is the variance of the mean. The standard error of the mean is \\sigma_{\\overline{x}} = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2_{\\overline{x}}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} frequently abbreviated to s.e. or S.E.M.\n\n\n\n10.5.2 Randomization\nWhich treatment is applied to each experimental unit should be decided at random (if appropriate after forming blocks). The idea is to be objective. One should avoid any subjective or approximately random procedures, which would invalidate any statistical test based on the data collected from such an experiment. In addition to assigning treatments at random, other possible sources of bias should be avoided by randomization:\n\nThe order in which measurements are done in the different experimental units should be randomized. Never measure all the experimental units receiving one level of treatment together and then all those receiving another level of treatment together. If the design includes blocks, then do the measurements by block, with the order of the different levels of treatment assigned at random within blocks. Be particularly careful if using more than one machine of the same type to make sure that the machines have been cross-calibrated. Likewise, if more than one person is working on an experiment, test that both people use the same criteria for taking measurements by comparing their readings when measuring a subsample of the same experimental units.\nIf several treatments are applied to each experimental unit in a sequential design, the order in which they are applied should be randomized.\nEverything that can be randomized, should be randomized to avoid bias, and to ensure that the assumptions behind statistical tests of significance are fulfilled.\n\nRandomization is of fundamental importance because:\n\nIt allows the organization of an experiment to be objective.\nIt prevents systematic errors from known and unknown sources of variation, because when randomized, these sources of variation should affect all treatments equally ‘on average’. Randomization guarantees that the estimators obtained for the treatment effect and of the error variance are unbiased. This in turn allows valid conclusions to be derived from statistical tests.\n\n\n\n10.5.3 Blocks and covariates\nIn designs with blocks we arrange the experimental units into homogeneous groups (according to some important characteristics). Each of these groups is called a block. Treatments are randomized within the blocks, normally with all treatments present in each block at least once. If blocking is successful it decreases the error variance because the systematic variation between the blocks can be separately accounted for in the analysis. If blocking is not successful, the estimator of error variance is not significantly reduced, but has fewer degrees of freedom[^37].\nEvery effort should be made to use and retain a balanced design (i.e. blocks of the same size, and an equal number of replicates for all treatments) since this makes analysis and interpretation of results much simpler. There are sometimes advantages to the adoption of more complex (but still balanced) designs that use the same principles as blocking, but allocate treatments to groups based on more than one criterion. Examples of these are Latin square and Greco-Latin square designs. See Box [ex:stats:block].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\nIf the experimental units belong to two, or more, statistical populations, then the best option is to use a design that acknowledges this. Such populations could be distinct soil series, cultivars or even years.\nFor example if we have three different cultivars of a crop that are important in a certain region for which we want the conclusions from our experiment to be applicable, we need to include several experimental units for each of the cultivars. In this case, structure should be added by classifying the units into three blocks one for each cultivar. In this way the sensitivity of our test will not be affected by the additional variation due to cultivars, but the results will be applicable to the three of them, instead of just to one.\nIf we suspect that the cultivars may respond to UV differently, the appropriate design would be a factorial one, which would allow to assess this difference through the interaction term.\n\n\nEven if it is impossible to group the experimental units into homogeneous blocks, it may be possible to measure some relevant property of the experimental units before applying the treatments. Afterwards, this measured variable can be included as a covariate in an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), or linear mixed effects (LME) or non-linear mixed effects (NLME) model. This may improve the performance of the statistical tests, by accounting for some of the random variability among experimental units. In any case, one should be careful with interpretation of ANCOVA results (Cochran 1957; Smith 1957). Including a covariate in a model does not lessen the requirement for proper randomization.\nThe flowchart below summarizes the designs most suitable for different simple cases based on the characteristics of the experimental units.\n\n\n\nChoice of statistical design based on the type of variation among the available experimental units.",

    "text": "10.6 Experimental units and subsamples\nIt is very important to understand the difference between experimental units and subsamples. This is crucial because correct statistical analysis is only possible if we correctly identify the experimental units in our experiments. An experimental unit is the unit or ‘thing’ to which the treatment is assigned (at random) (e.g. a tray of plants). An experimental unit is not necessarily the unit that is measured, which can be smaller (e.g. a leaf from a treated plant). A measured object (= measurement unit) which is smaller than an experimental unit is called a subsample (or subunit).\nIn a simple design the experimental units are usually easy to identify. The same is true for non-hierarchical factorial designs (i.e. when the factors are not nested). However, in hierarchical designs, like split-plot designs, the experimental units for one factor may be nested within the larger experimental units used for another factor. In such a case, the error terms in an ANOVA will be different for the different factors, and will also have a different number of degrees of freedom. Another common situation occurs when treatments are applied to experimental units and the same units are measured or sampled repeatedly in time. In this case it is not appropriate to apply a factorial design, with time as one factor, in an ANOVA since this would assume that all observations are independent. Instead one should use a design that takes into account the correlation among the repeated measurements. See examples, and the flowchart for a summary of how the relationship between experimental and measurement units affects the data analysis.\n\n\n\nIn an experiment we grow three plants per pot. We have nine pots. The treatments are three different watering regimes, which are assigned to the pots. We measure photosynthesis on individual plants. We get three numbers per pot. The pots are the experimental units. The photosynthesis measurements from each plant are subsamples. The subsamples are not independent observations. The (random) assignment of the treatments was not done on the plants, so the plants are not experimental units. The treatments were assigned to the pots.\nn = 3, N = 9\nn is the number of true replicates. N is the number of experimental units in the whole experiment.\nIn an experiment we grow three plants per pot. We have nine pots. The treatments are three different foliar fertilizers, which are assigned (at random) to the plants within each pot. We measure photosynthesis on individual plants. We get three numbers per pot. The plants are the experimental units. The photosynthesis measurements from the plants are replicates. The three plants in each pot are not independent of each other. To account for this non-independence, the pots are treated as blocks in the statistical analysis. (Depending on the duration of the experiment and the differences in size between plants, in practice, using 27 pots with one plant per pot may be better.)\nn = 9, N = 27\nIn an experiment we grow one plant per pot. We have nine pots. The treatments are three different watering regimes, which are assigned (at random) to the pots. We measure photosynthesis on individual plants. We get one number per pot.

    "section": "10.7 Pseudoreplication",
    "text": "10.7 Pseudoreplication\nPseudoreplication involves the misidentification of the experimental unit as what is really the measurement unit, so giving a higher n than is truly the case. Examples of pseudoreplication are quite readily found in the scientific literature. In UV experiments pseudoreplication is particularly prevalent as researchers often mistake the plant for the lamp frame or filter as the experimental unit. Hurlbert (1984) was the first paper to bring this frequent problem of ecological research to light. Pseudoreplication is not just a small annoyance, it is a difficult problem in field experiments in ecology, and it frequently remains hidden within the Discussion and Conclusions sections of scientific papers. The most frequent scenario occurs when experiments are designed as a comparison of two typical experimental units but conclusions are applied to the whole population of units. In other words, conclusions are based on subsamples rather than on true replicates. Quinn and Keough (2002) describes this situation as a mismatch between the scale of treatments and the scale of replicates.\nPseudoreplication happens when subsamples are treated as replicates in the statistical analysis and interpretation.\nWhen an experiment is thoughtfully planned and the researcher is certain about the identity the unit of replication, it should be possible to avoid pseudoreplication. However, where an oversight in planning or logistics has made pseudoreplication unavoidable, the additional assumptions involved in the interpretation of any statistical tests must be clearly indicated in reports or publications arising from the study. See Box [ex:stats:pseudo] for examples of pseudoreplication and suggested ways of avoiding this problem.\n\n\n\nWe want to study the effect of radiation on the growth of plants. We have two rooms, one with only normal lamps supplying PAR and one with some lamps in addition to the normal lamps. We randomly assign 20 plants to each room. We measure the height of the plants after one week. This experiment has 20 subsamples per treatment, but only one replicate. (The treatments were assigned at random to the rooms, not to the plants). It is not valid to treat the subsamples as replicates and try to draw conclusions about the effect of radiation, since we have only pseudoreplicates. In this case pseudoreplication adds the implicit assumption that the only difference between the rooms was the irradiance. Our statistical test really only answers the question: did the plants grow differently in the two rooms?\nSeveral remedies are needed to obtain a wider range of validity from this experiment. Replicates in time can be created by repeating the experiment several times swapping the lamps between rooms. Such a situation is far from ideal because it is difficult to maintain plants and rooms in an equivalent state over time, since factors such as time of year and deterioration of lamps and filters must be accounted for. An additional step towards overcoming this problem would be to make a pre-experimental trial trying to create ‘identical’ conditions in both growth rooms and checking whether this results in any difference in plant performance.\nWe want to study the differences between high elevation and lowland meadow vegetation. We choose one typical lowland meadow (LM) and one high elevation meadow (HM). We establish 5 plots, located at random, within each meadow. In each plot we mark ten 1 m^2 sampling areas at random, and record the species composition within these areas.\nIt is not valid to try to answer the question ‘is species x more frequent in lowland meadows than in highland meadows’ using the plots as replicates, since we have only pseudoreplication. The context of the question posed is critical in this instance. For this question we have, one true replicate (one meadow of each type), 5 subsamples (the plots) within each meadow, and 10 subsubsamples within each subsample. If the experiment is performed as described, it can only answer the question: “Is species x more abundant in meadow ‘LM’ than meadow ‘HM’?” If we want to draw conclusions about the two (statistical) populations of meadows, we should sample at random from those populations. For example compare five different highland meadows to five lowland meadows.\nWe have three UV-B lamp frames. The radiation from the lamps in one frame is filtered with cellulose di-acetate, in another frame the lamps are filtered with polyester, and in the third frame the lamps are not energized. We chose at random three groups of 100 seedlings and put one group under each frame. This is an un-replicated experiment, we have one experimental unit (one lamp frame) per treatment. If we use the plants as replicates, we commit pseudoreplication. The plants are subsamples, not replicates.\nIdeally we would try to obtain more lamp frames. If this was impossible, a replicated experiment could be created by sub-dividing the area under each lamp frame into two separate parts, and allocating one half of each containing 50 seedlings to be filtered by cellulose di-acetate and the other half by polyester. The unenergised lamp treatment would have to be omitted, but this compromise would enable three replicates of the two treatments to be created. Each lamp frame would be a block.\nWe have nine UV-B lamp frames, three for each treatment. We put 100 plants under each frame as above. We do the statistical analysis based on the measurements on each plant considering the plants as replicates, we commit pseudoreplication. Our estimate of the error variance is wrong, as it does not reflect the variation among frames with the same treatment, and degrees of freedom are hugely inflated. \nAlternatively, we do the experiment exactly as in the item above, but we calculate means per frame for the measured variable, and then use these means in the statistical analysis. In other words we analyse our data using the frames as replicates. We have a valid test of significance, because the error variance reflects the variation between equally treated experimental units (the lamp frames). Logistical constraints often require that a decision must be made about whether to measure more plants under fewer replicates, or fewer plants under more replicates. When such a compromise has to be made, it is nearly always preferable to have more experimental units and to measure fewer plants within each one, even at the expense of greater allocation of time and resources to the maintenance of filters and lamp frames.",

    "text": "10.8 Range of validity\nThe range of validity of the conclusions of an experiment derives from the population upon which the experiment was performed. These conclusions can not be extrapolated beyond the statistical population from which the experimental units were randomly chosen. The wider the range of validity, the more generally applicable the information obtained from an experiment will be. If we wish to perform an experiment with broad applicability we can increase the breadth of the sampled population, but in doing so we run the risk of having more heterogeneous experimental units. This can make treatment effects more difficult to detect, unless we take special measures to control this error variation.\nIf we do an experiment with only one inbred variety of a crop species the results and conclusions will apply only to that variety. If we mix the seeds from several varieties and assign the plants at random to the treatments, we enlarge the range of validity of the results and conclusions but we increase the random variation. We can control for this increase in variation by using several varieties as blocks. In this way, we increase the range of validity of the results and conclusions without increasing the random variation.\nThe design of an experiment involves many compromises concerning its range of validity, these relate to trade-offs between generality, precision, and realism, not to mention cost.\n\n10.8.1 Factorial experiments\nOne way of increasing the range of validity of the results of a scientific study is to use a factorial design for an experiment. For example, if we study the effects of radiation on well-watered plants only, then the conclusions of our study will be valid only for well-watered plants. If we include a second factor in our design with three levels, ‘drought’, ‘mild drought’ and ‘well watered’ and include all the treatment combinations possible, e.g. based on the three levels of watering and three levels of attenuation we have nine treatments and the range of validity is greatly expanded. In addition we can statistically test whether these two factors interact[^38]. Factorial experiments are a very powerful and useful design but if too many factors and levels are included their interpretation may become difficult. Factorial experiments with many factors and/or levels result in a statistical analysis based on many different contrasts[^39]. In this case, we should remember that in most analyzes we wish to obtain P-values per contrast, rather than per experiment. If we want to keep the experiment-wise risk level constant, we should use a tight contrast-wise risk level, or adjust the P-values.\nThe flowchart below describes the relationships between the structure of treatments and suitable methods for tests of significance.\n\n\n\nChoice of type of model fitting or statisitical test of significance based on the design of the experiment and approaches used for treatment assignment or randomization.",

    "text": "10.9 When not to make multiple comparisons\nIn the biological literature, multiple comparison procedures such as Tukey’s HSD are frequently used in situations where other tests would be more effective and easier to interpret. In some other cases multiple comparisons are used in situations in which they give misleading results. We will discuss the two most common cases of misuse of these tests.\n\n10.9.1 Dose response curves\nIf we have several levels of the same treatment, for example several different irradiances of UV, the most powerful (capable of reliably detecting effects) test is to fit a regression (either linear or non-linear) of the response on the “dose”. From such an analysis we get information on the relationship between dose and response, whether it is increasing or decreasing, linear or curvilinear, even its shape can be inferred. In many cases we can also calculate a confidence band around the fitted function. This is all useful and interpretable information.\nIf instead we calculate for example HSD or LSD and compare the responses to all possible pairs of doses, we discard the information about the ordering of the doses, and we can get results that do not address our research hypothesis, for example, concluding that all pairs of adjacent doses do not differ significantly while the extreme doses do differ significantly. In this type of experiments we are really interested in the slope and shape of a dose response curve.\nMultiple comparisons should be carried out only when there is no ordering in the levels of a treatment of factor. A regression or ANCOVA model should be used instead, if a reasonable model can be fitted.\n\n\n10.9.2 Factorial experiments\nFactorial experiments are very useful and as discussed above allow extending the range of validity of our conclusions. However, the main advantage of factorial experiments is that the significance of interactions can be tested. The most important part of the statistical analysis of a factorial experiment is an ANOVA with a model including main effects and interactions. Only after this test, one can in addition, test the differences among different pairs of treatments. This a posteriori test provides little extra information and should be done only if the interaction term is statistically significant. Otherwise, if the levels of a factor are discrete and unordered, and its main effect is significant in ANOVA, a multiple comparison test can be used to compare the levels of a factor (but not the individual combinations of levels of the different factors).",

    "text": "10.11 \nIn this section we list recommendations related to the statistical design of experiments for studying the effects of radiation on plants. See sections 8.6.1 and 8.6.2 for recommendations on manipulation of radiation, section 9.15 for recommendations on how to quantify radiation, and section 10.9 for recommendations about plant growing conditions.\n\nAvoid pseudoreplication. In most experiments where irradiance is manipulated either with lamps or filters, individual plants or pots are not true replicates. The true replicates are the lamp- or filter frames. Design your experiments and analyze your data taking this into account.\nAvoid pseudoreplication. In experiments under controlled conditions, if treatments are assigned to chambers or rooms, these chambers or rooms are the true replicates, not the plants within them. To have true replicates you will need several rooms per treatment. When this is not possible, the experiment can be repeated in time, using the same chambers or rooms, but reassigning the treatments, so that each chamber is used for a different treatment in each iteration of the experiment.\nInclude enough true replicates in your experiment. Many effects of radiation are small in relation to the mean and subtle in comparison to natural levels of variability. Reliably detecting these effects requires well-replicated experiments.\nAs a rough rule of thumb, aim at having at least 32 plants per treatment for growth, ecophysiology and metabolite measurements, in at least four true replicates composed each of eight measured plants in controlled environment and greenhouse studies. When making gas-exchange readings, it is usually impractical to measure from more than four to six plants in each of the four true replicates. If you aim to make an ecologically-orientated outdoor study it would be advisable to have at least five true replicates. In addition to issues of replication, in most cases you will need to have unmeasured border plants surrounding your experimental plants so as to avoid edge effects. Alternatively the positions of plants can be rotated every few days.\nPreferably use a design with blocks to control all known or expected sources of error (or background variation) that would otherwise confound the treatment effects. Examples of such sources of variation are different benches in a greenhouse, or measurements done by different observers. If you suspect that a known source of error may interact with your UV treatment, you may decide to consider it as a covariate in your model.\nWithin the blocks, use randomization to neutralize the effects of other error sources. Randomization is of fundamental importance and should be done properly: i.e. a device that generates a truly random assignment of treatments to experimental units should be employed. Such devices can be as simple as a coin, or die, or can be a table of random numbers in a book, or (pseudo-) random numbers generated by a computer or a pocket calculator.\nWhen designing an experiment use power analysis to determine the number of replicates needed, unless you have a long experience of performing similar experiments, and a good existing understanding of the amount of variability you expect to find in your results.\nIf your experiment yields a non-significant difference, use a posteriori power analysis to demonstrate, if possible, that biologically important differences would have been detected had they existed. However, if power analysis reveals that your experiment was unable to detect biologically important differences, you should repeat the experiment with more replicates or an improved design.",

    "text": "11.1 Introduction\nLack of reproducibility in scientific research is a broad problem that has woken up the interest of politicians and the general public (Fineberg2019). For example the US Congress requested the US National Academy of Sciences to produce a report about this problem (Fineberg2019). This chapter deals with problems that keep reappearing both in submitted manuscripts and published articles related reproducibility of photobiological research with plants.\nWe can divide problems of reproducibility into two broad categories: 1) contradictory conclusions in experiments intended to test the same hypothesis using different experimental set ups or methods, and 2) inconsistent results between an earlier experiment and a new instance of the same experiment following exactly the methods description of the earlier experiment.\nIn the first case, the design of the treatments or the interpretation of the results can be flawed, usually because of unfulfilled implicit or explicit assumptions or an invalid data analysis. In the second case, the likely problem is a mismatch between the description of methods and what has been actually done. It is not uncommon that both categories of problems coexist, because of the lack of description of an unrecognised false assumption.\nIn our field of research, the main sources of difficulties seem to be the mismatch between methods and research aims, the incomplete description of methods and the misinterpretation of experimental results by ignoring the limitations of the protocols and methods used. Even though rather few papers published in our field are flawed in ways that would require retraction, a very large proportion of papers are unnecessarily weakened in their usefulness and trustworthiness to some degree by these problems.\nThe problem is not a phenomenon restricted to low impact journals but it affects also very highly ranked journals. Given that papers with avoidable flaws are being accepted for publication, the problem concerns authors, reviewers and editors. The problem of reproducibility affects many fields of research and improvements are possible, and in many cases, even easy to implement. It also means, that as readers, we need abide by the good practice of critical reading and not accepting at face value conclusions from published papers. Examples follow, starting with one related to the first category: the artificial radiation treatments that are frequently interpreted as roughly equivalent tests of responses to UV-B radiation by plants.",

If the original data are not shared it can be impossible to validate the conclusions using an alternative approach to the analysis, or to effectively combine the data with that from other studies in a metaanalysis.\nIncompletely described methods hinder a knowledgeable reassessment of conclusions by readers and prevent the verification of the results of an experiment by replicating it. They also hinder the reuse of the results in meatanalysis.

    "section": "11.2 Controls and treatments in UV research",
    "text": "11.2 Controls and treatments in UV research\nIn any comparative study, controls and treatments are equally important. Control and treatment conditions must be chosen with equal care and described in the same detail. The “treatment” is the sum of all differences present between treatment and control, both intended and not intended.\nObviously the reliability of what we infer from this comparison is limited by the sum of the weaknesses of the two. The question of suitable controls in UV research has been already discussed in depth, most frequently in relation to UV-supplementation studies carried out outdoors (Newsham et al.1996). The same argumentation concerns laboratory and controlled environments experiments.\nIn all cases, the question is to identify all relevant differences between treatments and controls, and design both controls and treatments in a way that makes the observed effects interpretable as a test of the scientific hypothesis under evaluation.\nAll light sources have side effects like emission of radiation at wavelengths shorter and longer than UV-B including thermal radiation. Lamps can also shade radiation from other sources and potentially create electromagnetic fields.\nThere are huge differences among UV-B radiation treatments in frequent use both when expressed as a flux of photons Figure 11.1 or using different weighting functions Figure 11.3. A key difference is in the amount of radiation outside the UV-B waveband and in which wavelength within the UV-B band predominate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.1: Difference spectra between different pairs of UV-B treatments and controls for frequently used experimental setups in controlled environemnets. The spectra are scaled to an equal UV-B irradiance difference of 1\\,\\mu \\mathrm{mol}\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}. The numbers on the bars indicate the proportion of the total irradiance difference in each wvaveband.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen using a photon flux to describe the treatment, one should keep in mind that the waveband definitions in the UV region are rather arbitrary when used with plants, and that the effectiveness of photons varies in most cases, continuously with wavelength both within and between the standardised definitions of UV-B and UV-A radiation. Thus, the same UV-B photon irradiance from two different UV-B sources is unlikely to trigger responses that are quantitatively equal, and in many cases, not even qualitatively consistent.\nWe can attempt to match the effects of different UV sources using biological spectral weighting functions (BSWFs). The problem is that different responses follow different spectra for effectiveness, and these responses may be triggered concurrently. Thus, the use of BSWFs gives only an approximation to the real effectiveness in relation to a specific response. One frequently used BSWF is the generalised plant damage spectrum (CaldwellXXXX?) shown in Figure 11.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.2: Caldwell’s generalised plant damage spectrum extrapolated to 250 nm using Micheletti’s formulation. The numbers on the bars indicate the proportion of the total irradiance difference in each wvaveband.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the the generalised plant damage spectrum a BSWF we obtain an spectrum of the expected effect of different wavelengths as present in the output of a light source. The areas under curves in Figure 11.3 describe the expected effect from the same UV-B photon irradiance from the different UV sources from Figure 11.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.3: Difference spectra between different pairs of UV-B treatments and controls for frequently used experimental setups in controlled environements weighted with Caldwell’s generalised plant damage spectrum. The spectra were scaled to an equal UV-B irradiance difference of 1\\,\\mu \\mathrm{mol}\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1} before applying the biological spectral weighting function. The numbers on the bars indicate the proportion of the total irradiance difference in each wvaveband.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe action spectrum of UV responses mediated by UVR8 can be expected to have the same shape as the absorption spectrum of the UVR8 protein. We can use this spectrum, shown in Figure 11.4 as a BSWF to obtain the curves in Figure 11.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.4: In-vitro absorption spectrum of the UVR8 protein, expressed as absorbance. Normalised. The numbers on the bars indicate the proportion of the total irradiance difference in each wvaveband.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.5: Difference spectra between UV-B treatments and their controls for frequently used experimental setups in controlled environements weighted with the in-vitro absorption spectrum of the UVR8 protein. The spectra were scaled to an equal UV-B irradiance difference of 1\\,\\mu \\mathrm{mol}\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1} before applying the biological spectral weighting function. The numbers on the bars indicate the proportion of the total irradiance difference between treatment and controls in each wvaveband.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is naïve to expect plants to respond similarly to all of the different combinations of UV sources and controls. Quantitative reproducibility can be expected only when comparing identical or very similar irradiation setups. Thus, it is hugely important that the actual treatment and control used are described in enough detail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich treatments are “wrong”?\n\n\n\nA treatment is “wrong” only if it does not address the aim of the study. Goodness or badness stems from a match or mismatch between aims, treatment and interpretation of the results.\n\nA comparison between unfiltered broad-band UV-B lamps and darkness, does not inform about the effect of UV-B radiation, because only 34% of the emitted short-wave radiation is in the UV-B. However, it does inform about the effect of the lamps on their own, which in some applications may be of interest.\nOutdoors at ground level, only wavelengths longer than 293 nm are present. Thus any treatment that includes shorter wavelengths is of doubtful relevance to plants growing outdoors: this includes both unfiltered narrow-band-, broad-band UV-B lamps and many UV-B LEDs. If all radiation is between 280 nm and 315 nm, such treatments are valid tests for the effect of UV-B radiation, but not a good test of the effect of solar UV-B radiation.\nIn nature UVR8 is activated by both UV-B and UV-A2, thus in some cases UV-B sources that also emit UV-A2 may be the best match to the aims of an study, while being a bad choice to test for the effect of UV-B radiation.",

    "text": "11.3 Incomplete methods description\nA surprisingly large number of papers reporting on experiments carried out in the laboratory fail to mention if the UV-treatments were applied under a background of white light or in darkness. We are also only rarely told under which conditions the controls were kept while the treatments were applied (e.g., same irradiance of visible light, same temperature, etc.).\nThe spectrum and irradiance of the background UV, visible and NIR radiation is almost never reported. The lack of this information makes experiments not reproducible by independent researchers and can easily make results from different studies seem contradictory. This tends to be the result of authors relying on implicit, and frequently unwarranted, assumptions for the interpretation of results, such as “weak background illumination can be ignored”. Does this matter? Yes, because the ratio between different wavelengths affects responses (Krizek2004; Yan et al.2020) through signalling interactions downstream of UVR8 and other photoreceptors (Lau et al.2019; Morales et al.2015; Moriconi et al.2018; Rai et al.2019,2020; Tissot and Ulm2020) and because UVR8 can also participate in the perception of UV-A2 radiation (Rai etal. 2020).\nConsequently, the interpretation and the range of applicability of the results of an experiment about UV-B or any other narrow region of the spectrum, depends on information about the whole spectrum to which plants are exposed. Results from earlier studiesthat describe methods in enough detail can be re-interpretedin the light of later advances, but those reported with incomplete methods,cannot.",

    "text": "11.4 Unrealistic assumptions\n\n11.4.1 Light sources\nUnrealsitic assumptions are not only about plants, they can also affect the instruments and equipment such as light sources.\nSpecifying a lamp type in many cases does not provide enough information. In the long run manufacturers tend to revise the specifications of the lamps they sell without changing the type name or code. There is variation from batch to batch, and for LEDs even between individual LEDs of the same type, so much that many classify them into “bins” or subtypes based on the measured peak wavelength and emission efficiency. Specially the “fantasy names” like “UV-B lamps or UV LEDs” used by some lamp sellers are far from informative. UV-B, UV-A, and black light broadband lamps all emit visible light and UV-radiation at other wavelengths than those expected from their names. In many cases even codes derived from such names are inconsistently used.\nThe peaks of emission can be at different wavelengths for equivalent lamps from different suppliers (e.g., “black light blue” or BLB lamps have maximum emission at either 385 nm or 368 nm depending on supplier or vintage). In addition the output of both fluorescent lamps and LEDs depends on ambient temperature and on their age. In the case of UV-B fluorescent lamps the effect of temperature on the irradiance is very large, something that many researchers seem not to be aware of. In the case of white flourescent tubes, not only the irradiance but also the emission spectrum can be affected by temperature.\nBe aware that reflections from walls, tables, glass and metal objects, and even clothes can distort the spectrum impinging on plants. Not only reflection is important in the case of UV radiation, many objects fluoresce strongly in the blue or other regions when illuminated with UV radiation, e.g., whitepaper and clothes, and laundry powders contain fluorescent additives that are added so that paper and clothes look whiter (Björn et al.2012).\nWhenever possible we should provide a measured spectrum for the UV and visible radiation source(s) actually used, measured under the same ambient conditions and at the same physical location as in the reported experiment. Measurements should be done close in time to when the sources were used if not at the same time. Do not trust previous measurements or manufacturer specifications to be representative of your use case.\n\n\n11.4.2 Petri dishes, microscope cover slides and other barriers\nRarely the existence or not of a barrier and whether the irradiance or spectra have been measured behind the barrier or in front of it is reported. Even less frequently the exact type and supplier are reported. If light or UV treatments are applied through the lids of Petri dishes, a cover-slip or microscope slide, a water layer or there is anything else than air in the path of the radiation, the spectrum and irradiance could be significantly affected. As we do not see in the UV or NIR, what looks transparent, may not be so in UV or NIR.\nThe shape of the barrier or vessel can also make it function as a lens. So irradiation of liquid samples is best done in vessels with a square cross section, i.e., the same reason why spectrophotometry cuvettes are almost never round like normal test tubes. We need always to measure (or at least estimate) the spectrum and irradiance and define treatments as received by the target organism behind any barrier that separates it from the radiaiton source. We also have to remember to take into account that the angle of incidence matters both for glass or plastic barrier and the organism.",

    "text": "11.5 Mistakes and surprises\nOver reaction to surprising results. Over-interpretation and too-early dumping of surprising results are embarrassing and wasteful, respectively. Over- and misinterpretation of results are common, specially in those journals that too easily accept newsworthy and controversial reports. In the case of surprising results that are discarded too early we can only guess that this can also easily happen.\nReported values that are incompatible with the description of what and how was measured are worryingly common in publications. It is almost always possible for researchers to assess the “sanity” of the measured values obtained. For example molar extinction coefficient values for proteins can roughly and easily be estimated on the basis of the amino acid sequence. This is only an approximation, but if our measured values are nearly two orders of magnitude larger, we should carefully investigate what is going on.\nIf our estimate of water vapour pressure is higher than that expected at 100% relative humidity we should check our instruments and their calibration. If the UV-B irradiance from our lamps is many times lower than what others have reported for the same lamps, filters and distance, we should check calculations and measuring instruments. These examples are real, and for the last one I know of two cases, due to different problems. Of these four examples two made all the way to publication and two were caught in time. In the first two cases, I have no idea of the cause behind the bad data. In one of last two cases, calculation errors were the cause, and in the other case a completely wrong calibration of a new spectrometer, supplied by the manufacturer caused the problem.\nThis may sound disappointing, but in my experience, most unusual and surprising results from routine measurements using usual methods and applying similar treatments as others have earlier used are caused by methodological problems and mistakes. On the other hand, surprising results can be real, and tell an unexpected story, even if caused by mistakes, when the nature of the mistake is known.\nDeeper problems are caused by jumping to conclusions too easily. The solution is to be distrustful of any results, specially those that seem too good or too bad to be true. Cool down your enthusiasm or despair, imagine yourself for a while as an external reviewer, picky and suspicious of everything. But, of course, do remember to switch back to your positive and enthusiastic self once you have checked your data and before you deal with the problems you may have found!",

In most cases, sharing a script with commands that are used in the analysis is the most reliable way of reporting them, even though full reproducibility makes it necessary in many cases to have access to the same versions of the software used. Here is where the use of free open-source software that is also archived and with all past versions freely available makes reproducibility nearly unrestricted. The use of non-free and closed-source software restricts reproducibility to those able to afford the cost of the software. In addition, rarely commercial suppliers of software maintain all earlier versions readily available to users.\nFor bigger sets of tools, authors may opt to publish the software, such as R packages, separately from the data or paper, and even describe it in a separate methods paper.

Scientific knowledge advances by the revision and correction of previous theories and hypotheses (see Godfrey-Smith2003, for an introduction to the phylosophy of science).

These are linked, and this link builds upon earlier ideas and data. Depending on the case, the data or the ideas will be relevant for a longer time, while the link between them will frequently become outdated first. Data for which methods are incomplete have little value in themselves, as they cannot be reinterpreted in the light of new ideas. Conclusions and knowledge that are built upon evidence whose strength or reliability cannot be independently assessed contribute little to scientific progress. If they guide subsequent research unnecessarily into conceptual dead-ends they disturb the normal progress of scientific research causing expensive distraction of resources. So, we should strive as a community to retroactively correct if possible or alternatively highlight the flaws and inaccuracies in our own and in other authors’ publications, both old and recent. This is simply how science issupposed to self-correct errors and we should not be afraid of doing so.\nBoth in terms of career progress and contribution to society we have to avoid thinking only in the short term or with a narrow view. More broadly, the evaluation and rewards systems used for scientific research need to be reformulated so that the premium for doing reproducible and useful scientific research vs. flashy and unwarranted controversial or hastily done but overinterpreted studies is very clearly in favour of the first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bottom line\n\n\n\nResearch is expensive, but justified based on the benefits it can provide to our society. Bad science derails decision making and biases resource allocation. Even if “bad science”, intentional and accidental, has a much more direct and dramatic impact in medicine and health care (Goldacre2010) than in our research field, the same principles apply and are applicable to efforts to improve plant production and food security (Sadras et al.2020). There is constant tension in the allocation of funding to research, as most research ultimately competes for taxpayers’ money that could be used to improve voters’ well-being in other more direct ways. We ensure that our work provides the maximum benefit to society if the fruits of our work can be trusted and the quality and relevance of the data we generate can be properly and independently assessed. Transfer of knowledge to stakeholders is a crucial step, but first we need to generate knowledge that stakeholders can trust and use with benefit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAphalo, Pedro José. 2020. “Reproducibility of UV-Research with Plants.” UV4Plants Bulletin 2020 (1): 61–71. https://doi.org/10.19232/uv4pb.2020.1.24.",

    "text": "12.1.1 Risks related to sunlight exposure\nWhen working in field experiments, workers and researchers are exposed to sunlight as in any other outdoor activity. To avoid health hazards adequate protection should be used, either in the form of clothing or sun-blocking lotions. In some cases, for example when there is strong reflection of radiation by water, sand or snow-covered surfaces, eye protection in the form of sunglasses or goggles should be used.\nA common and simple parameter of the UV radiation level outdoors is the index, which was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) including recommended protection (WHO 2002). The index is used for example in weather forecasts in integer numbers from 1 to 11+, representing the exposure from low to extreme. [^14]\n\n\n12.1.2 Risks related to the use of UV lamps\nLamps emitting and create a higher risk of eye damage than sunlight because when radiation is not accompanied by strong visible light the eye pupils remain wide open. Also many lamps emit , which is not present in sunlight at ground level and is more damaging than . It is important to use goggles to protect the eyes not only from radiation from the front but also from the sides of the face. It is important to ensure that the goggles used are designed to protect from radiation, rather than just from the impact of flying particles. The skin should also be well protected, because in the same way as for plants, the effect of -B on humans is enhanced under low visible light irradiance by the low rate of photoreactivation (light-driven repair of DNA damage).\nLocations where lamps are in use should have visibly located warning signs. Although there is no standardized symbol for radiation hazard, the warning symbol for optical radiation (Figure [fig:warning:optical]) accompanied by the text ‘UV radiation’ can be used. Additional text, ‘protect eyes and skin’ or ‘do not look directly at light source’ can be added. Access to outdoor experiments should be restricted by fences with locked gates, and by locking access doors to greenhouses, controlled environment rooms and cabinets. This is to prevent exposure of people who are unaware of the risks involved. Everybody with access to the area should be informed of risks, and trained to use the protection and work procedures required to mitigate them.\n\n   \n\nLamps also pose risks unrelated to radiation. Fluorescent tubes contain mercury and should disposed of as hazardous waste. The glass envelope of lamps is fragile, and can cause injuries if it breaks. Xenon-arc lamps also present a relatively high risk of explosion, goggles and other face and body protection should be used. This risk is caused by the high pressure inside this type of lamp and is present irrespective of the xenon-arc lamps being on or off.\nLasers, can easily produce injuries, and should be handled with great care. Even the very low power laser pointers used during lectures are capable of injuring the eye if pointed towards the audience. As with light sources, access to any type of laser should be restricted to trained users, and eye protection should be worn to match the wavelength emitted by each particular laser. Recommendations relating to warning signs, given above, apply equally to lasers and UV lamps.\n\n\n12.1.3 Risks related to electrical power\nUsing mains power for either instruments or lamps, involves a risk of electric shock and this is especially true in humid conditions and outdoors. All components, like connectors, enclosures, and switches, should have an IP rating[^15] and any other codes required for their use in a particular environment. When using mains power in a room where there is water, it is usually a requirement to have grounded mains sockets protected with residual current devices (RCD). These sense the current imbalance in the power line caused by a current leak to ground, for example caused by the accidental flow of current through the body of an operator. When this residual current is sensed, the device trips and disconnects power in a few milliseconds so preventing serious injury. RCDs and earth grounding should be regularly tested. Never use an electrical device that has a grounded plug in a mains socket lacking ground contacts because this will create a risk of electrocution and in addition may negatively affect the functioning of measuring instruments.\n\n\n12.1.4 Safety regulations and recommendations\nThe EU directive 2006/25/EC about protecting workers from optical radiation can be found at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:114:0038:0059:EN:PDF. This directive does not apply to solar radiation. It gives maximum allowed levels of exposure from artificial optical radiation sources and other requirements on how to achieve these and the monitoring of workers health. Britain’s Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has produced a guide on how to apply this directive (not approved yet by EU), that can be found at http://www.hse.gov.uk/radiation/nonionising/optical.htm. At this address, there is also information on sun exposure indicating that ‘UV radiation should be considered an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors’. The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued general recommendations about protection from the sun, which can be found at http://www.who.int/uv/sun_protection/en/.",

    "text": "12.2 Artificial sources of UV radiation\n\n12.2.1 Lamps\n\n12.2.1.1 Fluorescent lamps and tubes\nFluorescent lamps and tubes are low pressure mercury vapour lamps. The mercury vapour emits radiation at specific spectral lines, mostly in the UV region of the spectrum. Except for the case of germicidal lamps the inside of the glass tube is coated with a layer of ‘phosphor’[^16] which absorbs UV radiation and re-emits the energy as fluorescence, at longer wavelengths, either as , , or visible radiation. There are even some fluorescent tubes producing far-red radiation around 750 nm. For environmental studies we are interested in and emitting lamps. These lamps emit across a rather broad wavelength band, and have several minor secondary peaks in the and visible regions. Figure [fig:TL12:UVB313:UVA340] shows the emission spectra of some UV lamps.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nIt should be remembered when designing experiments that lamps should be always filtered with cellulose diacetate film or some other material to remove , otherwise the effects observed will not be only due to but also to radiation. The emission of radiation might look small in energy terms but, being very effective in eliciting biological effects, it is capable of completely distorting the apparent response of plants and other organisms to radiation in an experiment. In the case of lamps, both and radiation should be removed by filtration.\nUltraviolet emitting fluorescent lamps also emit a small amount of visible radiation, even in the red and orange regions of the spectrum. This should not be forgotten when using these lamps as the only source of radiation. For example the very small amount of red-orange light can be enough to enhance germination of silver birch seeds in Petri dishes when irradiated with lamps (Pedro J. Aphalo, unpublished data).\nThe most commonly used and lamps are 1200 mm-long tubes, rated at 40 W of electrical power. These lamps are sold for materials testing (Q-Panel UVB-313 and UVB-340, Q-Labs Inc., Farnworth, England) and for medical use (Philips TL-40 W12, and TL-40 W 01, Philips, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The second of these lamp types from Philips emits over a very narrow peak, and are not suited for simulating ozone depletion, but might be useful when the aim is not to simulate solar radiation. There are also other lamp types available, for example small-sized compact fluorescent lamps such as PL-S 9W 01 from Philips.\nUsing fluorescent lamps requires some additional equipment (Figure [fig:fluorescent:tube]). The main component is a “ballast” which limits the current through the lamp. Traditional ballasts are electromagnetic, comprising a coil wound on a ferrous core, and require one more component, a ‘starter’ for turning on the lamps. Lamps driven by such ballasts run at power-line frequency, 50 Hz in Europe and 60 Hz in USA, causing emission to flicker in time. This flicker is not visible to humans, but is visible to some insects. The modern alternatives are electronic ballasts driving the lamps at high frequency (in the order of 50–100 kHz) which together with the latency of the phosphor yields an almost constant radiation output from the lamps. Consequently, we recommend the use of high frequency ballasts to avoid artifacts. Electronic ballasts do not require starters.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nSome types of electronic ballasts are dimming ballasts , allowing the adjustment of lamp output from full power down to a ballast-type-specific low value, usually somewhere between 1 and 10% of full power. Dimming of lamp output can also be achieved using electromagnetic ballasts and phase-angle dimming controllers but these enhance the visible flicker of the lamps. Some ballasts are designed for newer T8 (thin, 26 mm diameter) tubes rather than the old-fashioned T12 (thick, 38 mm diameter) tubes used for most lamps, which may cause some problems with dimming, and affect the lowest power level achievable. Dimming ballasts are controlled digitally (for example DSI system for Tridonic PCA 1/38 T8 ECO, Tridonic GmbH & Co KG, Dornbirn, Austria) or by a direct current voltage signal (for example 1–10 V for Quicktronic HF 1X36/230-240 DIM UNV1, Osram, Munich, Germany). Dimming ballasts can be useful for adjusting doses for different treatments, or when building modulated supplementation systems (see section 8.2.6 on page ).\nRadiation output from fluorescent lamps varies markedly with ambient temperature as shown in Figure [fig:UV:lamp:temperature]. The data in this figure were obtained by varying the temperature in a growth chamber where the lamps were located, and measuring the spectral irradiance with a spectroradiometer maintained at near constant temperature outside the chamber. Only the optical fibre entered the chamber through an instrumentation port. In non-modulated systems, and in experiments with treatments at different temperatures this should be taken into account and the irradiance from lamps should always be measured at the same temperature as during use of the lamps in the experiments. When the ambient temperature fluctuates, the lamp output should be measured continuously, or at least at a range of temperatures and irradiances estimated from a continuous record of temperature.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nirradiance should never be adjusted by using different plant to lamp distances in different treatments. Changing the distance modifies the shading effect of lamp frames, and even small differences in can create spurious differences between treatments (see Flint et al. 2009 for details). Furthermore, it is essential to have controls both under frames with unenergised lamps and also under frames with energized lamps but filtered with polyester film to remove the , as the only difference between and non-treatments should be the irradiance of (see Newsham et al. 1996). If we want to assess the effect of shading by lamp frames alone an additional control with no lamp frames could be added to an experiment.\nFluorescent tubes are normally held on metal frames, and each frame supports several lamps. Because these tubes are long and narrow, using single tubes would provide a very uneven irradiance field. Care should be taken when choosing the spacing of the tubes, and the vertical distance between the tubes and plants. The model of Björn and Teramura (1993) can be used to simulate the spatial distribution of irradiance or fluence rate under such an array of lamps (for a reimplementation of the model as an R package see section 8.8 on page ). Figure [fig:position:tubes] shows the results of six such simulations, three for tubes evenly distributed along the frame (‘equidistant’) and three for tubes arranged following the projection on a plane of what would be equidistant distribution around the perimeter of a half circle (‘cosine’ pattern). The closer together the contour lines are, the steeper the change in irradiance. The examples in Figure [fig:position:tubes] are for irradiance, and these results do not apply to fluence rate. For each size and number of lamps and size of frames, it should be possible to optimize either the evenness of irradiance or of fluence rate by means of the model (Figure [fig:position:tubes:square]). The unevenness of the radiation field should be taken into account when deciding where to the place plants, and also when measuring exposures under the frames.\nWhen using UV lamps to supplement solar radiation, shading by the lamps and their supporting structures can become a problem. This is discussed in section 9.10.3 on page in relation to effective doses and enhancement errors.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n12.2.1.2 Xenon arc lamps\nXenon arc lamps are specialised light sources that produce intense visible and UV radiation from an electric discharge in high pressure xenon gas. The lamps comprise tungsten electrodes inside a quartz envelope and produce an intense plasma ball at the cathode at 6000–6500 K temperature generating a spectral output throughout the visible and UV (Figure [fig:xenon:lamp:spectrum]). Xenon arc lamps must be operated in a fully enclosed housing (Figure [fig:xenon:lamp:photo]) that usually provides mirrors and focussing adjustments, electrical ignition and ventilation to cool the lamp. Xenon arcs provide intense point sources but with careful operation and adjustment are sometimes useful for experiments in photobiology. They are extremely strong sources and have a very high heat output in the infra-red waveband. This heat output typically requires their use with a water filter and/or a dichroic mirror reflector to reduce heating if used in experiments with plant material. A dichroic mirror transmits infra-red onto a heat sink and reflects only the required waveband (e.g. UV radiation) onto the target. After removal of excessive heat using a water filter or dichroic mirror they can be used with narrow band-pass filters for the determination of effects at different wavelengths such as action spectra. Care must be taken not to focus the source onto the mirror or filter which can be readily damaged by excessive heat.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nIn addition to the essential safety considerations when using any UV sources (detailed in section 8.1), important additional safety precautions are necessary when using xenon arc lamps. The high pressure inside the lamps creates a risk of explosion during installation and during operation, which increases with lamp age. An impact resistant face shield and heavy protective gloves should be worn when handling a lamp and it must never be touched with the fingers as grease marks increase the risk of failure. Lamps are supplied in a protective cover which should remain in place until installation and they should only be used inside a specialised housing that provides explosion protection to contain flying glass should an explosion occur. A specialised lamp housing is normally provided with a fan for cooling the lamp which gets extremely hot and ventilation should continue for at least five minutes after the lamp is switched off. This is usually achieved in a specialised housing with temperature sensors or timers. However, some lamps (sometimes called ‘UV-enhanced’) produce short UV wavelengths (&lt;250 nm) that generate large quantities of ozone which is toxic and can cause respiratory problems and asthma attacks. The ozone must be removed from the room and building by additional ventilation systems or absorbed and destroyed by special filters. Alternatively, ‘ozone-free’ lamps are most often used and have a quartz envelope that absorbs below 250 nm and so prevents excessive ozone formation. A xenon arc lamp is extremely bright and the intense visible radiation can damage the eyes in addition to UV effects. The arc or its intense image must never be viewed directly as it can cause permanent eye damage. When using the equipment, the illuminated areas may also be extremely bright and dark coloured goggles should be worn, such as those used in welding that also provide UV protection, ensuring that the eyes are also protected from side illumination as well as directly. It is essential to follow the manufacturers’ instructions with respect to lamp life and operating current in order to maximise their useful life and minimise the risk of failure due to explosion. Further information on xenon arc sources and other high intensity lamp sources sometimes used in photobiology is provided by Holmes (1984).\n\n\n\n12.2.2 Deuterium lamps\nHigh intensity water-cooled deuterium lamps (150 W) have a fairly flat radiant intensity curve in the UV-B region (approximately 1.5–3.0 between 280 and 300 nm at a distance of 30 cm) that is appropriate for mechanistic plant UV photobiology studies. This type of radiation sources (e.g. produced by Hamamatsu Photonics) requires a dedicated control box for operation but is still an affordable alternative to lasers, starting at about 2,500€ for a setup. High intensity deuterium lamps have been used for wavelength dependence measurements both in photobiology (Kalbin et al. 2005; Kalbina et al. 2008) and photochemistry (Kalbin et al. 2005) when fitted with the appropriate filters. The lamp has to be mounted horizontally to allow efficient water cooling but using spreading lenses and a mirror mounted in a 45^\\circ angle to the incident radiation a full rosette can easily be irradiated (Kalbina et al. 2008) and, the UV irradiation can be supplemented with PAR from external sources as desired. A drawback of this type of equipment is the short life of the radiation source (a few hundred hours). Spare lamps cost approximately 1 500 €.\n\n\n12.2.3 LEDs\nThe principle of a light emitting diode (LED) is totally different to conventional incandescent light bulbs. It is a semiconductor consisting of two types of layer: one layer releasing electrons as a direct current to fill holes in another. Energy is released as a photon at a wavelength (colour) that depends on the band gap energy of the materials comprising each of the two layers (Figure [fig:LED:junction]).\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nDue to this emission of photons at a very precise wavelength, the typical spectrum of a LED shows one distinct peak. The emitted wavelength range can be increased by adding a fluorescing material to the LED. This is shown in Figure [fig:LED] together with a measurement of the solar irradiance at the Helmholtz Zentrum München in Neuherberg, Germany. The maximum spectral irradiance of the LED peak (measurement at 20 cm distance) is more than one order of magnitude lower than that of the solar irradiance (which is the reason a semilogarithmic scale is used). All measurements were made using a double-monochromator spectroradiometer (Bentham, Reading, UK).\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nIf the correct semiconductor material is chosen, almost any wavelength can be produced even in the UV range. The intensity of LEDs (Figure [fig:UVLED]) is much lower than that of LEDs emitting visible light, even at a shorter distance than in Figure [fig:LED]. Normally, the optical power of a LED is around 1 W or less for visible radiation and only around 0.5 mW for UV radiation. There are LEDs available with higher power (many of them are arrays of tens of chips on a single package) but they require an additional cooling device. These arrays can emit up to 50 mW of radiation, however, they are very expensive. This is one of the most important reasons why LEDs alone are not useful at the moment for exposing plants to radiation. In addition, many different LEDs or specially designed LEDs are necessary to approximate the wavelength distribution of the solar spectrum. On the other hand, LEDs have been in common use for photosynthesis research for a long time (Tennessen, Singsaas, and Sharkey 1994) and many gas-exchange instruments use LEDs as a light source.\nLEDs are low voltage direct current (DC) devices. The current through a LED must be limited. The simplest current limiter is a resistor connected in series with the LED. The calculator at http://ledcalculator.net/ can be used to determine the value of the required resistor. There is also a handy pair of Android applications, ‘elektor LED Resistor Calculator’ and ‘elektor Resistor Color Code’, available for free from Google Play (https://play.google.com/).\n\n\n12.2.4 Spectrographs\nA spectrograph composed of a light source and a monochromator may be used in applications requiring spectrally-resolved UV radiation exposure of biological specimens. This may be the case when searching for wavelength dependencies in plant responses or investigating specific effects known a priori to depend on wavelength.\nThe selection of a light source is application driven and depends on the requirements imposed by the study. The main requirements concern the intensity and the spectral distribution of the radiant output of the lamp. The geometry of the setup, including the source-target-distance and the area of exposure, sets certain limits not only on the light source but also on the characteristics of the monochromator.\nA schematic representation of a typical single monochromator is shown in Figure [fig:spectrograph]. The light emitted by the light source is directed onto the entrance slit of the monochromator. The collimating mirror reflects the light onto the grating that diffracts the light into its spectral components. The diffracted light is reflected by the focusing mirror onto the exit slit. Two single monochromators may be aligned in a way that the exit slit of the first monochromator serves as the entrance slit of the second monochromator. This arrangement makes up a double monochromator which provides better stray:light rejection than single monochromators. Commercially available monochromators of both types exist.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nIn the setup of a single monochromator shown in Figure [fig:spectrograph], photons of only one wavelength would ideally exit the exit slit. However, as the slits have finite dimensions, the actual output would be a narrow line of radiation, peaking around a certain nominal central wavelength. Two approaches are commonly adopted to achieve the production of multiple spatially-separated lines. The grating may be equipped with a drive arm rotating the grating. Ideally, for each position of the grating, only radiation of a certain wavelength is reflected and focused onto the exit slit one at a time. Alternatively, the focusing mirror may be omitted and replaced by a sample exposure plane. Ideally, in each position on the plane, only radiation of a certain wavelength would be present (Figure [fig:UVEMA]).\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nThe main characteristics of a monochromator that should be considered include wavelength region, wavelength accuracy, bandwidth of the lines, and the amount of stray light. These characteristics set guidelines for design of the layout of the optical components, selection of the slit widths, and formulation of the specifications for the grating. An unavoidable compromise must be made between the wavelength resolution and the intensity. Finer separation of the wavelengths comes with lower intensities and vice versa. Stray light rejection may be improved by placing suitably-designed baffles inside the enclosure of the spectrograph. For applications requiring superior stray light rejection, a double monochromator should be used.\nThe main characteristics of the grating include groove spacing and a ruled area. For a spectrograph operating at UV radiation wavelengths, a holographic grating is a more feasible choice than a ruled grating because it can achieve a higher resolution. The main difference between ruled and holographic gratings is the process of their manufacture. A ruled grating has grooves scribed by a diamond on a ruling machine, whereas holographic gratings are produced by a photolithographic process using lasers which are able to achieve a higher groove density. Should the focal plane be flat, a concave grating must be used. The size of the grating has certain practical limits set by the manufacturers. The maximum size of the exposure area is essentially limited by the size of the grating.\nSelection of the light source is defined by the desired wavelengths, the intensity levels, and the spectral distribution of the radiation. For experiments imitating natural exposure, light sources exhibiting radiative characteristics resembling those of natural sunlight, such as xenon-arc lamps, should be used. The heat tolerances of the substrates of the gratings are limited. As a consequence, the light entering the monochromator may have to be filtered to remove excessive infra-red radiation which is often achieved using a water filter. (see subsubsection 8.2.1.2 on page )\nIn addition to the small spectrographs described above, there are also much larger instruments. Many of these dispense with the exit slit, and project the dispersed spectrum onto a ‘stage’. Watanabe et al. (1982) describe a large spectrograph designed for irradiating biological samples. Over a curved 10 m-long focal plane covering wavelengths of 250 to 1000 nm, many samples can be irradiated simultaneously. There are few such spectrographs in the world, but they are important for measuring action and response spectra (e.g. Saitou et al. 1993).\n\n\n12.2.5 Lasers\nLaser stands for ‘Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation’. Stimulated emission can be induced in many different materials, and when light is confined in a cavity between mirrors the stimulated emission is amplified yielding a narrow beam of spatially- and temporarily coherent, and collimated light. Lasers usually produce very narrow and intense beams of monochromatic light, although there are exceptions. Some lasers are tunable, meaning that the wavelength of the emitted light beam can be varied. One of the many ways of achieving this is to replace the mirror at one end of the cavity with a movable prism or grating. The lasing medium can be a solid crystal, a gas or a dye in solution. Lasers are said to be ‘pumped’ by a source of light, for example a lamp external to the lasing cavity.\nLaser diodes are semiconductor lasers. They are solid state devices producing a laser beam based on the same principle as other lasers. They are pumped by the light emitted when electrons and ‘holes’ interact in the semiconductor junction. They are used to excite other types of lasers, in printers and CD/DVD/BD players. Blu-ray disc players use laser diodes which emit blue-violet light. There are emitting laser diodes of low power, for example, emitting 20 mW at 375 nm. The semiconductor material used in this case is . In addition the catalogue of Roithner Lasertechnik GmbH (Vienna, Austria) lists ‘diode pumped solid state lasers’ emitting at 266 nm and at 355 nm. Non solid-state lasers that emit in the region are also available. For example argon ion lasers continuously emit at wavelengths of 334 and 351 nm.\nThe power of lasers varies from 1–5 mW for laser pointers to 100 kW for lasers under development for military use. The coherent and concentrated beam can cause serious damage to eyesight, and safety precautions should be taken during their use, unless they are of very low power (see section 8.1 on page ).\nLasers can be used for example in characterizing the slit function of spectrometers (see section 9.7.2.2 on page ), for aligning optics, and in the ubiquitous barcode readers used in supermarkets and laser pointers used by speakers during lectures. They are used in instruments like confocal microscopes and different analytical procedures in chemistry and biology. They can also be used to excite photochemical or photobiological systems if the target is small.\nFor the purpose of UV photobiology, tunable optical parametric oscillator (OPO) pump lasers (pump wavelength 355 nm) are especially useful in mechanistic studies such as in accurate wavelength dependence determinations or action spectroscopy (O’Hara, Strid and Jenkins, in preparation). Placing a cuvette holder in the beam, a plant extract or a protein solution can be accurately irradiated using 50 or 100 cuvettes. By using the appropriate optics (lenses, mirrors, etc.; Figure [fig:tunable:laser]), the geometry of the beam can be manipulated so that a larger area or sample (several cm^2) can be illuminated. This is large enough for exposing for instance part of an rosette, or for simultaneously irradiating two detached leaves. Tuneable lasers can also be used for studies of complex mechanistic interactions between several plant photoreceptors, since they can be used within a short time interval (seconds) at different wavelengths, e.g. for irradiation first in the , then in the blue or red.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nWhen using lasers for photobiological purposes, a number of circumstances need to be taken into account. Lasers emit their radiation in the form of pulses and this should be kept in mind when designing the experiments. Usually, both the energy of the pulses and the pulse rate can be varied within limits, depending on the sophistication (and price!) of the equipment. Pulse rates between 1 to 20 Hz in the more affordable machines up to 1000 Hz in the more expensive ones can be obtained. The pulses are typically 5–10 ns in length and the linewidth is usually around 0.5 nm (Figure [fig:laser:output]), making this type of instrumentation ideal for studies of the initial UV signalling events on the biochemical and cell biological levels. Also, due to the physical principles on which a tunable laser in the UV region relies, some residual radiation with double the desired wavelength may still be present in the beam exiting the apparatus. This has to be taken care of by using a filter in the light-path blocking the longer wavelengths. For instance, when irradiating a plant with a wavelength of 300 nm, care must be taken so that any 600 nm component will be blocked out to be sure that the biological effect is due to the UV-B alone and not the red light. Of course, the laser UV-B radiation can be supplemented with PAR from other light sources as required.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nLaser radiation is measured as the energy emitted (in J) in each pulse or in a train of pulses using a pulse energy meter. This then has to be related to the area actually irradiated. The maximal output energy for a flash at 280 nm typically ranges between 40 and 200 . The spectral bandwidth and the accuracy of the wavelength setting should be checked prior to use with a calibrated diode array spectroradiometer (Figure [fig:laser:output]). As might be expected, the major drawback of using lasers, in addition to the small area that usually can be irradiated, is the cost. Lasers useful for UV-B photobiological purposes at present start at approximately 50 000 €.\n\n\n12.2.6 Modulated UV-B supplementation systems\nThere are two types of supplementation systems for use outdoors: square-wave and modulated. Square-wave supplementation systems work by simply switching the lamps on and off. The only control on the dose of is the length of time that the lamps are energized each day. Modulated systems work by continuously adjusting lamp -radiation output, which is usually called dimming. Furthermore, in modulated systems, the dimming of the lamps is adjusted by means of a feedback control system. radiation is measured both with supplement and without and the control system is programmed so that the treatment is a fixed percent increase in above the control condition, or in some cases, above true ambient conditions. McLeod (1997) reviews many of the early modulated and square-wave systems, and discusses many of the compromises and limitations involved in their use and design. Figure [fig:botania] shows one lamp frame from a modulated system, and Figure [fig:botania:new] shows an overhead view.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nA modulated system automatically adjusts the supplement following changes in natural irradiance with time of day and also compensates for ageing of cellulose diacetate filters, and changes in lamp output with ambient temperature.\nCaldwell et al. (1983) describe a modulated system based on custom built electronics, which works even at very low ambient temperatures. Aphalo, Tegelberg, and Julkunen-Tiitto (1999) describe a system built from off-the-shelf components and controlled by a datalogger, which does not work at temperatures below 0. Figure [fig:UV:modulated] shows, for this system, the daily course of irradiance under near-ambient control and enhancement frames throughout two days with different cloud conditions. Occasionally, modulated systems have also been used inside greenhouses (e.g. Hunt and McNeil 1998). Another approach is to use a PID algorithm in an industrial micro-controller module to control the dimming of the lamps. Such a modulated systems has been built based on Gantner intelligent modules (Gantner Instruments Test & Measurement GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany, Matti Savinainen, pers. comm.). It is also possible to use a personal computer and a PID control algorithm implemented in a graphical instrument control and measurement language like LabVIEW (National Instruments Corporation, Austin, TX, USA) or FlowStone (DPS Robotics, UK).\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nModulated systems, like any other supplementation system, require frequent checks and replacement of burnt lamps and aged filters. It is recommended to replace acetate filters regularly. For lamps (except for the odd ‘early deaths’) it is recommended that they are replaced following a fixed schedule as lamp output degrades with lamp age. This is especially important in those systems not having separate feedback control for each lamp frame, as having lamps of different ages in monitored and slave frames would lead to inaccuracies in the level of supplementation between frames.\nModulated systems are preferable to square-wave systems as they avoid excessive supplementation during periods of low and low natural irradiance. They also compensate for fluctuations in lamp output. However, they are more difficult to design and build, and consequently more expensive. The drawbacks of square-wave systems can be moderated by completely switching off the system on rainy and cloudy days, or by automatically switching off supplementation when irradiance goes below a certain threshold. The duration of square-wave exposure may also be limited to fixed hours either side of solar noon. Musil et al. (2002) evaluated the errors involved in the use of square-wave systems and concluded that they are not very large, whereas Díaz et al. (2006) concluded that modulated systems are preferable. However, it is difficult to assess the effect of the unrealistic treatments in square-wave systems on the outcome of experiments as comparisons have been solely based on differences in irradiation regimes rather than on the responses of plants.\nEnhancement errors in the calculation of effective irradiance are discussed in section 9.10.3 on page .\n\n\n12.2.7 Exposure chambers and sun simulators\nTwo main types of sun simulators exist: small systems based, for example, on xenon-arc lamps (see 8.2.1.2 on page ), and large systems built by combining several types of lamps and filters to achieve a simulation of the solar spectrum; so called “sun simulators” and “(walk-in-size) exposure chambers”. The latter are sometimes called a ‘phytotron’ (Bickford and Dunn 1972). The principal concept of how to design plant growth chambers can be found for example in Langhans and Tibbitts (1997).\nHere, a description is given in more detail of the phytotron built at the Research Unit Environmental Simulation of the Helmholtz Zentrum München, Neuherberg, Germany[^17]. This phytotron facility consists of a set of seven closed chambers (length \\cdot width \\cdot height):\n\nfour walk-in-size chambers (3.4 m \\times 2.8 m \\times 2.5 m),\ntwo medium-size sun simulators (1.4 m \\times 1.4 m \\times 1.0 m),\none small sun simulator (1.2 m \\times 1.2 m \\times 0.4 m).\n\nIn order to extrapolate response of plants from experiments to those in their natural habitat, these experiments need to be performed under realistic and reproducible conditions. The radiation provided must be as realistic as possible. Not only the quantity but also the spectral quality of radiation has to match the seasonal and diurnal variations occurring in nature (Caldwell and Flint 1994). This includes the steep absorption characteristics of radiation that result from the filtering of solar irradiance by stratospheric ozone as well as the balance between the , , and . As no single artificial light source can simulate both spectral quality and spectral quantity of global irradiance, a combination of metal halide lamps (400 W HQI Daylight, Osram, Germany), quartz halogen lamps (500 W Halostar, Osram, Germany), and blue fluorescent tubes (40 W TLD 18, Philips, the Netherlands) are used in order to simulate the spectrum from the to the near IR wavelengths. Excess infra-red radiation is removed by a layer of water. Underneath this water filter, additional quartz halogen lamps (300 W Halostar, Osram, Germany) are installed to adjust the mid and far IR radiation. The missing irradiance is supplemented by fluorescent tubes (40 W TL 12, Philips, the Netherlands). The radiation output of these fluorescent tubes, however, extends to well below 280 nm. This portion must be blocked very efficiently. Selected borosilicate and lime glass filters as well as acrylic ‘glass’ filters and plastic sheets provide a sufficiently steep cut-off at the desired wavelength. Different combinations of these glasses and films allow the cut-off wavelength to be altered, thus enabling a simulation various scenarios as shown for example in figure [fig:Poly:Spectra] in section 7.8 on page . The diurnal variations of the irradiance are achieved by switching appropriate groups of lamps on and off. The optimised lamp configuration of the ceiling is presented in Figure [fig:SoSi:Lamps]. A more detailed description is given by Seckmeyer and Payer (1993), Döhring et al. (1996) and Thiel et al. (1996). Figure [fig:sunsimulator] shows a picture of a sun simulator and the schematic outline.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lamps are mounted far above the cultivation area in order to obtain a homogeneous spatial distribution of the radiation. Deviations from homogeneity, indicated by the ratio of spectral irradiance at any position to that at the central position, do not exceed 20% for all wavelengths but, due to non-symmetric lamp mounting, can depend on wavelength. The horizontal distribution of in the cultivation area is shown in figure [fig:SoSi:horizontal]. The horizontal distribution of and radiation is similar and not shown here.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nFigure [fig:SoSi:sun] shows a comparison of the spectral irradiance of the small sun simulator, provided with a double layer of Tempax glass (Schott, Germany), and a typical outdoor spectrum measured at the field station of the Helmholtz Zentrum München, Neuherberg, Germany. Measurements in the sun simulator show that the steep, realistic shape of the edge and the ratio can be simulated very close to nature. The ratio of the sun simulator is 1:23:194 and matches the natural conditions of 1:25:206 very well.\n\n\n\n\nTypical irradiance data from the phytotron compared to a field measurement (on 17 April 1996 at the Helmholtz Zentrum München, Neuherberg, Germany, solar zenith angle \\theta_s = 38\\degree) are listed in table [tab:SoSi:values].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall\nLarge\nOutdoor\n\n\n\n\n\n1.53\n1.20\n1.10\n\n\n\n54.9\n22.7\n47.2\n\n\n\n430\n250\n390\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides the lighting, temperature, and humidity, the atmosphere in the chamber is also controlled. Typical gaseous pollutants such as ozone, nitric oxides, and combustion residuals can be introduced. The effects of carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons on plants can also be studied. Modern control technology with central monitoring ensures a safe and well-defined operation.",

    "text": "12.3 Filters\nIn UV research, optical filters are used in different contexts, in measuring instruments and in UV radiation sources. In the case of instruments, they are used in most broadband sensors to achieve the desired spectral response. They are also used in some spectrometers to improve stray light performance and remove second order artifacts.\nThey are used in lamp sources like laboratory solar simulators based on xenon arc lamps. In experiments with UV-B fluorescent lamps they are used to absorb short wavelength radiation in the UV-B treatment and to achieve comparable no UV-B controls. These uses are discussed in section 8.2.1 on page . In the current section, in addition to introducing the optical properties of filters, we will mainly discuss the use of filters to manipulate the spectrum of sunlight in field experiments.\n\n12.3.1 Optical properties of filters\nThere are different types of filters. Band-pass filters transmit radiation in a given range of wavelengths or band, and absorb or reflect light outside this range. The band can be either wide or narrow. Cut-off filters can be either long-pass, or short-pass: respectively transmitting all radiation of longer wavelengths than a cutoff wavelength and transmitting all radiation of wavelengths shorter than a cutoff (less common). The transition is a slope that can be steep or gradual depending on the filter.\nJust like any object, filters reflect, absorb or transmit radiation. These are the only three possible fates of incident radiation. reflectance (), absorptance () and transmittance () are the corresponding fractions of the incident radiation such that \\refl + \\abst + \\trans = 1 (or if expressed as percentages they add up to 100%). Absorptance should not the confused with absorbance () which is a different quantity given by \\absb = \\log \\frac{1}{\\trans}. All these quantities can be defined either for a broad band, or for very narrow band (e.g. where \\lambda is the wavelength). In the latter case, we can measure across wavelengths obtaining a spectrum.\nWhen describing filters, the main property of interest is spectral transmittance. Most filters work by absorbing radiation of the unwanted wavelengths. However, some special filters work by reflecting the unwanted radiation. This is important when working with high power light sources: reflecting filters warm up much less that absorbing filters. An example of reflecting filters are the so called heat mirrors, which reflect infra-red radiation.\nFor light absorbing filters, like many of those made from plastic or optical glass, the optical characteristics depend not only on the material but also on its thickness. For this reason it is important to always indicate both type and thickness when describing a filter. In many cases one can take advantage of this phenomenon when planning experiments as the cutoff wavelength depends on the thickness of the filter.\nAnother important property of filters is whether they scatter radiation or not. When light is scattered the diffuse radiation component increases. For example, normal glass does not scatter visible radiation while opaline (white glass) does. As the proportion of diffuse radiation in PAR affects canopy photosynthesis (Okerblom, Lahti, and Smolander 1992; Urban et al. 2007, 2012; Markvart et al. 2010) one should use filters with similar scattering properties for all treatments.\nFilters can be made from optical glass, gelatine, and many different synthetic organic compounds. In many cases, coloured substances are used as additives to the whole thickness of the material but sometimes a layer is merely applied to the surface or between two layers of transparent material. Glass filters tend to be very stable, but many plastics and the additives they contain react when illuminated, and deteriorate gradually when exposed to visible- and especially UV radiation. Filters made from optical glass are a more expensive than those made from plastics and tend to be readily available only in small sizes. Plastic films used as filters tend to be available in large sheets or rolls. Sometimes, liquid filters, usually aqueous solutions of chemicals, can also be useful (see Chapter 11 in Montalti et al. 2006 for spectral transmittance for several liquid filters). Sampath-Wiley and Jahnke (2011) describe a new type of liquid filter which makes it possible to obtain a realistic simulation of the solar spectrum under laboratory conditions using normal fluorescent lamps.\nThe engineering quality of atmospheric UV absorption by glass filter techniques is sufficient for most plant experiments. However, this method has its limitations. Strong UV exposure causes rapid ageing of borosilicate glass filters due to a physico-chemical effect known as solarisation. This originates in UV-induced changes in the oxidation state of iron contaminants present in the glass matrix. The oxidation of Fe^{2+} to Fe^{3+} is accompanied by an absorption shift to longer wavelengths within the UV range. A decrease in the transmittance of fresh glass filters occurs within their first few hours of use, followed by a more-gradual long-term decline. Hence, changes in transmission during an experiment can be largely avoided by the pre-ageing of new filters. In addition, there is a gradient of ageing with the depth of the glass. Soda-lime glass exhibits very much reduced ageing compared to borosilicate glass. The solarisation of the soda-lime glass ceases after a few hours of UV treatment and this may be due to its lower content of iron contaminants (Döhring et al. 1996).\n\n\n12.3.2 Manipulating UV radiation in sunlight\nWhen using plastic films in the field they need to be supported in a way such that they remain in place even under windy conditions and also so that rainwater does not accumulate on top of them. It is important to be aware that plastic filters modify the microclimate in several ways. If they absorb infra-red radiation, even if transparent at other wavelengths, they will alter the energy balance of plants and soil under them. This produces a greenhouse effect that increases temperatures. If they absorb they will affect photosynthesis, and even small differences in transmittance () between treatments could be important. Plants are partially protected from wind and completely shielded from rain by the filters. In some cases even plasticizer additives (different phthalates) added during plastic manufacture have been implicated in artifacts caused by the use of cellulose diacetate film in exclusion experiments, particularly when ventilation is restricted (Krizek and Mirecki 2004).\nAs filters have so many side effects, it is not surprising that a comparison against a no-filter control usually yields large differences, demonstrating that comparisons examining the effects of UV attenuation should always be done against controls under UV transparent films. Of course, we may want to know how similar the conditions under control filters are to natural conditions. In this case at least two types of controls are needed: a control with a UV transparent filter and a control without any filter. Figures [fig:filters:photo:field], [fig:filters:photo:field1], [fig:filters:photo:one:frame] and [fig:filters:photo:branch] show some typical setups for potted plants and branches respectively. Filters on tree branches have been used by Rousseaux et al. (2004), Kotilainen et al. (2008) and others. Filters have also been used to cover patches of natural vegetation by Phoenix et al. (2003), Robson et al. (2004) and others. Filters have been used in experiments with potted seedlings or plants by Hunt (1997), Kotilainen et al. (2009), Morales et al. (2010), and others.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nThe spectral transmittance of several commonly used films is shown in Figure [fig:filter:T:spectra], and the resulting filtered sunlight spectral irradiance in Figure [fig:filter:sunlight:spectra]. For near-ambient-UV controls cellulose diacetate, polythene or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) are normally used. Cellulose diacetate is not a good option as its optical properties deteriorate fast, and after deterioration it absorbs more UV-B radiation (Figure [fig:filter:T:spectra:aging]), tears easily, and is affected by water. Cellulose diacetate is used for removing from the radiation emitted by lamps (see section 8.2.1.1 on page ). In contrast as there is no in solar radiation at ground level, other materials that are more durable can be used for near-ambient controls in attenuation experiments. Polythene film (types without UV absorbing additives only) is very stable, and cheap, but usually scatters light slightly more than the films used for UV-B attenuation. PTFE and related polymers (brand names Teflon, Hostaflon, etc.) are extremely stable, transmit UV radiation very well, and some types produce little scattering[^18]. Also films made from polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE) (sold under the trade name ACLAR) can be used. For UV-B attenuation experiments, polyester film (e.g. brand names Mylar, Melinex, Autostat) is the filter material most frequently used for attenuating with only a small effect on irradiance. Sometimes soda glass (normal window glass) or special acrylic plates are used instead of polyester. Polyester film produces little scattering and glass and acrylic panes almost none. For attenuation of the whole UV band, UV-absorbing theatrical gels can be used. They are called gels for historical reasons but nowadays either polyester or polycarbonate is used as base material. The most useful type is the one with code #226, available with similar specifications from several manufacturers (Rosco, Lee filters, Formatt filters, see the Appendix on page for addresses). Rosco #0 is an UV-A and UV-B transparent theatrical gel with spectral transmittance rather similar to thin cellulose diacetate. Some polyester films can also remove all UV wavelengths (e.g. brand name ‘Courtgard’). Some experimental greenhouse cladding films have cut-off wavelengths in the middle of the UV-A band and provide additional possibilities. Theatrical gels are available only in one standard thickness, but cellulose diacetate, polyester, PTFE and polythene films are available in several different thicknesses. Thickness affects both mechanical and optical properties (Figure [fig:filter:T:spectra:thickness]). The most common thicknesses used for cellulose diacetate and polyester are 100 to 125 . For polythene, thinner films can be used to minimize scattering if mechanical strength is not limiting (e.g. 50 ). As PTFE is a strong material, thin films can also be used, but one should be careful to match PAR transmittance between all treatments.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nFilters can be mounted on wooden, metal or wire frames, or sometimes, especially when covering branches, on chicken wire net. It is important to carefully chose the fastening method. On wooden frames staples or thumb pins can be used, but the films tend to tear where they have been perforated so reinforcing the edges with transparent or duct tape may be necessary. It is important to use tapes that produce no toxic fumes, and to use the same amount and type of tape for all treatments (e.g. not use more tape for the films that break more easily). In harsh environments, the propensity for filters to tear or fracture can be greatly reduced by stretching them taut over the filtered plots to keep them still. This can be achieved by unrolling filters firmly attached to two cylindrical rods/poles clamped under tension to a structure anchored in the ground (Figure [fig:filters:photo:field1] on page ), . This approach also has the benefit over wooden frames of enabling a large number of filters to be carried to the field at once undamaged, so can be of use to researchers working at inaccessible field sites. When mounting the filters good ventilation should be maintained, to avoid warming up of the plants and soil under them. Careful consideration is needed when making the compromise between the UV reduction achieved by adding plastic curtains to increase the filtration of diffuse:rad (or direct:rad when the solar elevation angle is small at high latitudes), and the exacerbation of warming and further reduction in ventilation that this will cause. In long-term filtration experiments, the growth of dense vegetation under and around the filters is a common problem which can lead to large unwanted changes in the microclimate in experimental plots.\nThe impracticality of filtering entire trees means that branch filters are often the most acceptable substitutes when assessing the effects of solar UV radiation on trees. However their installation and maintenance involves several additional considerations beyond those attached to fixed frames. Branch filters should be located only on the top and sides of branches, while the underside should be left open for ventilation and access. A structure of chicken wire and aluminium cables can maintain the shape of the filter while minimising contact between the filter and the treated part of the branch, however the weight of the structure should be kept to a minimum to reduce shading and the risk of mechanical damage to the tree. Filters mounted on branches behave like flags in the wind, so branches on which filters are installed need to be tethered to the ground or their movement stabilised using wooden canes attached to a different large branch or limb of the tree, or preferably a combination of both these restraints, so that they do not move un-naturally or break in windy weather. By necessity in such experiments, the filtered area is relatively small and requires frequent maintenance to keep the shoots and leaves from growing into the filter or growing too far away from the filter into areas where they receive too much unfiltered and diffuse UV radiation. Particular attention should be given to the orientation of branch filters on a tree. For instance, branches and filters orientated to the north receive a very different dose of visible and UV radiation from those orientated to the south (Rousseaux et al. 2004). Comparing similar branches of the same tree under different filtration treatments is an obvious way to reduce the random variability among experimental units, but it is important to be aware that signals could potentially pass between different filtered branches and unfiltered branches which may dilute the response of a particular branch to its UV treatment. One method of controlling for communication between branches involves excising the phloem of filtered branches. However, this isolation brings other problems as the realism of the experiment is reduced, so the need to adopt this approach will depend on the aims of each individual experiment. Maintaining branch filters in situ during the autumn and winter is not always practically feasible, however when using species that have determinate growth, their environment, particularly the radiation they receive, during bud set and the formation of leaf primordia can influence subsequent growth and leaf traits during the following growing season.\nSometimes the design of an experiment requires intermediate levels of attenuation, and this can be achieved by mounting strips of one type of plastic film on a base of another type (Figure [fig:filters:photo:one:frame]). In such a system the strips are usually fastened at the edges of the wooden or wire frame on which the whole filter is attached. Unless the frames are small (less than 30 to 50 cm long sides) it may also be necessary to attach the strips in the middle with tape. In such a case the tape used must be clear to both PAR and UV radiation. The cheapest old-fashioned stationery tapes use a cellulose acetate substrate and are good for this purpose (e.g. Scotch Crystal Clear). Strips are usually 10 to 15 mm wide and if the desired effect is 50% attenuation, they are attached with a separation equal to their own width. Cutting the strips with scissors is a big task, but printers’ shops can usually cut them efficiently for a small charge. The UV irradiance under filters with strips is heterogeneous but the patches move with solar transit through the sky. This is more of a problem for measurement of irradiances than for the application of the treatments as reciprocity between irradiation time and irradiance apparently holds for such experiments (Rosa et al. 2001).\nEven if we use filters that are totally opaque to UV-B, the treatment will not lead to total UV-B exclusion. That is why we use the phrase ‘UV-B attenuation’ for such treatments (Figure [fig:filter:maps]). As discussed in section 7.4 on page , solar UV radiation includes a large proportion of diffuse radiation coming from the sky, even under non-cloudy conditions. Consequently, some UV radiation penetrates under the edges of filters. It is therefore necessary to avoid locating experimental plants near the edges of the filters, and we recommend to have at least one row of border plants, forming a so-called ‘guard row’, from which no data are collected. Furthermore, it is possible to use curtains of the same filter material on the sides of the frames, but one should not close all sides as air movement is needed to avoid elevated temperatures and unnaturally still air. The filters should not be too high above the plants and irradiance should be measured at all the different positions where measured plants are located, rather than just under the centre of the frame.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n12.3.3 Measuring the spectral transmittance of filters\nThe recommended instrument for measuring filter spectral transmittance is a spectrometer or spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. Using an integrating sphere ensures that all transmitted radiation, both non-scattered and scattered is taken into account in the measurement. For non-scattering filters, one can obtain a reasonable approximation of the total spectral transmittance with a regular spectrophotometer. In most cases it is adequate to cut a piece of the film to the size of a cuvette and insert it carefully in the cuvette holder. In some models with an open light path (e.g. HP 8453, Hewlett Packard Gmbh, Waldbronn, Germany, now Agilent) it is possible to put a larger piece of filter material in the light path outside the cuvette holder but close to it. For measuring in the UV-B band one needs an instrument using a deuterium lamp as radiation source. The spectral resolution is important, and ideally should be 1 or 2 nm.\nThe optical properties of all filters change with time, even if the material from which they are made is stable, because filters get scratched and dirty. Dust and pollen stick to the filter surfaces and particles attach more tenaciously to some materials than others so that the filters in some treatments may become dirtier than in others. In addition to cleaning and replacing the filters regularly, it is necessary to measure the spectral transmittance of both new and used filters. We also recommend that samples of the filters are taken both at the start and end of their use and are stored protected from light and heat at least until the results of the experiments have been published, but preferably for longer.",

    "text": "12.4 Manipulating UV-B in the aquatic environment\n\n12.4.1 Incubations in the field\nIn contrast to the situation in terrestrial environments, field experimentation with aquatic organisms is constrained not only by the underwater light conditions but also by a suite of physical perturbations (e.g. wave action, tidal fluctuations, currents, sedimentation, etc.). In the case of benthic macrophytes, an important factor that has to be considered is their vertical distribution. Deep or constantly submerged environments impose different difficulties compared to e.g. intertidal locations, which are subjected to changing light conditions due to the action of tides. In lakes and rivers, differences in the concentration of suspended absorbing substances between the surface and deeper habitats can be important. An experimental design for the study of seaweeds normally includes different filters cutting-off and (see section 8.3 for details).\nAlgae can be exposed to these different radiation conditions by using self-made incubators constructed with plastic frames and nets with different diameters and forms depending of the size of the macrophyte (Figure [fig:marine:incubation]). Both the cylindrical and sheet Plexiglass incubators can be covered by appropriate UV cut-off films and located at different water depths by using ropes or buoys. E.g. as used by Gómez et al. (2005) with the red alga in the Quempillen Estuary (Chile). The cylindrical incubators can be also used in intertidal pools, allowing them to float or locating them at the bottom of a pool. In general, experiments dealing with effects of natural radiation on aquatic organisms are carried out in a range of depths between 0 and 10 m to represent the penetration depth in coastal waters.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nThe diurnal variability of solar radiation is one of the most important factors to consider when working with aquatic macrophytes in the field. In general, at temperate and cold-temperate locations, daily changes in the irradiance conditions are also exacerbated by depth, which affects the number of hours during which algae are exposed to radiation. It is well known that photosynthetic physiology changes during the day with maximum rates of photoinhibition (a mechanism of dissipation of excess energy) occurring during the highest solar irradiance at midday, while a recovery in the photosynthetic capacity is found in the afternoon (Häder et al. 1996; Figueroa et al. 1997; Gómez et al. 2004). This pattern is well generalized in macrophytes and strongly dependent on the growth depth: individuals growing at shallow depths show a more efficient photoinhibition than their deeper counterparts (Franklin and Forster 1997). Thus, experimental designs employing transplantation or incubations at different depths along the water column should consider these potential confounding effects.\nTides are also a relevant factor affecting radiation in shallow marine waters, especially for intertidal species. Fluctuations in the height of the water column caused by tidal regimes can reduce or increase considerably the available UV radiation. For example, in a study comparing two coastal systems with different tidal range, Huovinen and Gómez (2011) demonstrated that algae from fjords, with tidal ranges close to 7 m, exhibited less difference in photosynthetic light demand and susceptibility to radiation than algae from an open coast where maximal tidal variation was 2 m. Probably, this is a major factor influencing experimentation with benthic intertidal macrophytes, especially in highly dynamic systems that may also be characterized by strong wave action.\n\n\n12.4.2 Incubation under artificial lamps\nThe effect of radiation on aquatic plants can also be studied using incubations under controlled illumination conditions (using lamps) in the laboratory (Figure [fig:lab:incubation]). Normally the sources are similar to those used for incubations of terrestrial plants (see section 8.2.1).\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nIn general, experimentation on aquatic plants using small vessels under laboratory conditions is designed to test for effects of in isolated cells or small sized macrophytes. In the case of large seaweeds (e.g. kelps), space limitation restricts incubations to pieces or sample discs. In the case of seaweeds, due to their simple morphological organization, the use of cut sections still allows a realistic extrapolation of the situation in the whole thallus.\nThe optical characteristics and shape of the vessels containing the samples strongly determine the orientation of the sample to the UV source and the experimental setup. Often the vessels used in routine incubations are opaque to radiation (e.g. Pyrex, and many types of glass ware and polycarbonate), and thus lamps should be located above them. However, there are various transparent materials, e.g. methacrylate (Type GS-2458) or quartz glass, which permits irradiation from different sides and mimics better the natural underwater conditions. In experimental setups which cover vessels with cut-off filters, bubbles from aeration can affect the penetration and diffraction patterns within the vessels. Thus, cut-off and neutral filters should be kept at sufficient distance from the water.\nDue to the heat emission of lamps, temperature within the incubation chamber can vary considerably, which should be taken into account, similar as with incubations of terrestrial plants. This factor is especially relevant for algae subject to small changes in temperature in their habitat, e.g. some deep water and polar algae. Thermoregulated water baths can minimize this problem (Figure [fig:lab:incubation]).\nThe use of artificial sources presents various advantages. Firstly, the manipulation of the :ratio can permit the examination of some processes that normally are masked by the prevailing high irradiances in the field, as well as simulations of different scenarios. Secondly, it is possible to standardize conditions for physiology, a situation not normally possible in the natural habitat, where unpredictable environment conditions (e.g. water motion, scattered light field) make in situ experimentation difficult.",

    "text": "12.5 Suitable treatments and controls\nIn every experiment one must include a suitable control in addition to treatments. What is a suitable control will depend on the aims of the study. In order to assess the effect of radiation, then the only difference between an treatment and the control treatment should be the irradiance of . This may seem obvious, but it is important to think about the consequence of this for the design of experiments. Many sources emit in addition to radiation, , -A and visible radiation. Common sources emit in addition to , , and visible radiation. As most fluorescent and some other UV sources emit small amounts of radiation, which is absent in sunlight, radiation must be removed by filtration. See Box [ex:lamps:controls] for descriptions of some typical experimental designs and their advantages and pitfalls.\n\n\n\nCase\n\nWe use Q-Panel UVB-313 tubes, or Philips TL12 fluorescent tubes outdoors. These lamps are sold as broadband lamps, but they emit radiation of other wavelengths (, , and visible) in addition to (see Figure [fig:TL12:UVB313:UVA340] on page ). Our objective is to study the effect of radiation.\n\nDesign 1\n\nWe remove from the treatment by filtering the lamps with cellulose diacetate (see Figure [fig:filter:T:spectra] on page ). We add (and a very small amount of visible radiation) to the controls by having identical lamps as in the treatments but filtered with polyester film, which absorbs and . This also ensures that any effect of the lamps on the temperature of plants is similar in treated and control plants, and shading of sunlight is similar. This type of control is usually called ‘control’.\n\nDesign 2\n\nAs above, but in addition we add a second control with unenergized lamps. We can compare this control to the control to assess whether there is any side effect related to the functioning of the lamps but unrelated to radiation.\n\nDesign 3\n\nWe add a third control with no lamps or frames. By comparing this control with the control with unenergized lamps we can test for the effect of shading by lamps and supporting structures.\n\nDesign 4\n\nWe use cellulose diacetate-filtered lamps for treatments and unenergized lamps for controls. In this case the effect of is confounded with other effects of the lamps, except for shading.\n\nDesign 5\n\nWe use cellulose diacetate-filtered lamps for treatments and no lamps or frames for the controls. In this case the effect of is confounded with all other effects of using lamps.\n\nCaveat\n\nWhen discussing very small effects of treatments and the different controls there is always the risk of misinterpretation as the films used as filters are far from perfect, there is a transition zone between high absorptance and high transmittance spanning tenths of nanometres in wavelength (see Figure [fig:filter:T:spectra]). Consequently, controls will not be exposed to exactly the same irradiance of as treated plants. Usually they will be exposed to a slightly lower irradiance of plus a trace of .\n\nComparison\n\nDesign 1 is the simplest design that can be used to test for the effects of . Design 2, is preferable as it allows an assessment of the possible secondary effects of lamps, except for shading. Design 3, is rarely used, but allows an assessment all side-effects of lamps in addition to the effect of . Is useful in an ecological context where we are interested in assessing how much the experimental setup disrupts natural conditions. Design 4 should be avoided as it is unsuitable for testing the effects of radiation as all the different effects of the lamps are confounded with the effect of enhancement, except for shade. Design 5 is the worst possible, and should never be used.\n\n\n\nWhen using filters, one should take into account the side-effects of using them. In addition to absorbing different amounts and wavelengths of radiation, filters may have effects on visible and infra-red irradiance. No filter transmits 100% of visible light. In addition filters block precipitation and wind, and may increase the temperature of the air, vegetation and soil below them. So, one should always use, as the control for assessing effects of attenuation, a transparent filter rather than no filter. See Box [ex:filters:controls] for some examples of good and bad experimental setups.\n\n\n\nCase\n\nWe use polyester (‘Mylar’) film outdoors to attenuate radiation (see Figure [fig:filter:sunlight:spectra] on page ). Our objective is to study the effect of solar radiation.\n\nDesign 1\n\nWe attenuate radiation (but not radiation) in the -treatment by filtering sunlight with a polyester film. We use as a control a film that transmits and . This ensures that most of the effect of the films on precipitation, wind and temperature is similar for treated and control plants. Also shading of sunlight by supporting structures is similar. This type of control is usually called ‘near ambient control’.\n\nDesign 2\n\nAs above, but in addition we add a second treatment with a filter absorbing both - and radiation. We can compare this treatment to the attenuation treatment to assess whether there is an effect of radiation. \n\nDesign 3\n\nWe add a second control without filters or frames (‘ambient control’). By comparing this control with the near-ambient control we can test for the effect of filters and supporting structures.\n\nDesign 4\n\nWe attenuate radiation in our -treatment by filtering sunlight with a polyester film. We have as controls plots with no filters or supporting structures. In this case the effect of is confounded with other effects of the filters.\n\nCaveat\n\nWhen discussing very small effects of treatments and the different controls there is always the risk of misinterpretation as the films used as filters are far from perfect, there is a transition zone between high absorptance and high transmittance spanning tenths of nanometres in wavelength (see Figure [fig:filter:T:spectra] on page ). Consequently, near ambient controls will not be exposed to exactly the same irradiance of as plants under the -attenuation treated plants. Usually they will be exposed to a slightly lower irradiance of plus a trace of long wavelength .\n\nComparison\n\nDesign 1 is the simplest design that can be used to test for the effects of . Design 2, is preferable as it allows us to also assess the effects of solar radiation. Design 3, is not always used, but allows to assess all side-effects of filters in addition to the effect of radiation. This design is useful in an ecological context where we are interested in assessing how much our experimental setup disrupts natural conditions. Design 4 should be avoided as it is unsuitable for testing the effects of radiation as all the different effects of the filters are confounded with the effect of attenuation.\n\n\n\nIn the case of controlled environments, various combinations of lamps and filters are used to create different radiation treatments. As discussed above, if in order to test for effects of radiation, exposure should be the only difference between treatment and control conditions. For example, one can have a sun simulator, or at least a combination of lamps providing both - and visible radiation and then have different filters between the lamps and plants. The same principles as discussed in Examples [ex:lamps:controls] and [ex:filters:controls] apply to experiments in controlled experiments.",

    "text": "12.6 \n\n12.6.1 Recommendations for outdoor experiments\nIn this section we list recommendations related to the manipulation of radiation in outdoor experiments, and in section 8.6.2 list some additional recommendations on radiation manipulations inside greenhouses and controlled environments. See section 9.15 for recommendations on how to quantify radiation, section 10.9 for recommendations about growing conditions, and section 11.12 for recommendations about statistical design of experiments.\n\nMake sure that the only difference between the treatments you compare is what you want to test. If possible make measurements of the environmental conditions in the different treatments and report them in your publications.\n\nIn experiments with lamps avoid differences in irradiance among treatments. Such confounding differences can be caused by shade from lamps and the frames supporting them if they are kept at different heights. All treatments must have lamps that are switched on or off, covered with different filters or dimmed to different radiance values.\nIn experiments with filters avoid difference in irradiance and scattering. Filters used to block radiation and the frames supporting them have some attenuating and scattering effect on . All treatments must have similar supporting structures, be positioned at the same height, and the filters themselves must have as similar as possible transmittance in regions of the spectrum outside the region. All filters must have as similar as possible light scattering properties, as even if irradiance is the same, differences in the proportion of diffuse light affects the growth of plants.\nIn experiments with lamps avoid differences in temperature among treatments. Keep the distance between lamps and the top of the plants at least 0.4–0.5 m. If enclosures like open-top chambers are used, provide enough ventilation or cooling to remove the heat generated by the lamps.\nIn experiments with filters avoid differences in temperature among treatments. The main factor to consider in this case is ventilation and distance from the film to the top of the plants. An additional factor is the transmittance of the different films to longwave infra-red radiation. The filters can affect the temperatures both during the day and at night. If possible, measure the temperature of the plants and soil, in addition to the temperature of the air.\nIn experiments with filters avoid artifacts caused by plasticisers used in some plastic films used as filters. Ensure good ventilation and if possible avoid using cellulose diacetate films for near-ambient controls. When not using lamps there is no need to remove radiation and consequently the more stable and less toxic PTFE (Teflon) or polythene films should be used instead.\n\nIn experiments with lamps do not use unfiltered lamps. Most lamps also emit some that must be filtered with a cellulose diacetate filter in treated plots. Most lamps also emit , so an additional control should be included in all experiments. This control is achieved by filtering out both and radiation by means of polyester film. The smallest well designed experiment should include three treatments:\nIf the difference between near-ambient controls and true ambient conditions is of interest, then an additional true ambient control should be included to test how big is the effect of the small differences in air, soil and leaf temperatures, irradiance, air humidity and any other side-effect of the manipulations. In any case, when designing an experiment we should strive to minimize shading, alterations in temperature and ventilation.\nIn experiments with lamps, if at all possible, use modulated systems that avoid unrealistic ratios between - and irradiances. If the use of a modulated system is impossible, keep the lamps on only a few hours centred on solar noon and switch them off during cloudy weather.\nIn experiments with lamps use high frequency electronic ballasts rather than electromagnetic ballasts to drive the lamps, so as to avoid flicker in the radiation output, which can affect insect behaviour.\nIn all experiments using filters check periodically whether the spectral characteristics of the filters have changed and replace them when needed. Cellulose diacetate degrades particularly fast and, for example when used at about 0.3 m from lamps it should be replace after about 50 h of lamp irradiation. If wrapped on lamps, it should be replaced even more frequently. These times are approximate and can also be extended when using modulated systems.\nIn experiments using filters to attenuate in sunlight, even if the filters are not yet degraded or if they are made of stable materials like glass or PFTE (Teflon) the transmission characteristics will change by the accumulation of dust, dirt and pollen. If this happens, the filters should be cleaned or replaced.\n\n\n\n12.6.2 Recommendations for experiments in greenhouses and controlled environments\nMany of the recommendations in section 8.6.1 can be adapted to apply to indoor experiments. Here we list additional recommendations applicable to experiments in greenhouses and controlled experiments.\n\nKeep the balance between irradiance, irradiance and as similar as possible to that in sunlight and/or vegetation canopies. Many growth chambers and growth rooms achieve relatively low irradiances of . Avoid using high doses of in such cabinets. Some chambers and rooms have sheets of polycarbonate (PC) separating the lamps from the plants, in such chambers levels are negligible. In chambers using bare lamps, irradiance is unrealistically low, but usually not equal to zero. A visible- and radiation spectral composition truly matching sunlight can be achieved only with sun simulators.\nUnless you are specifically studying the effect of step changes in irradiance, for annual plants we recommend that the treatment starts at the time of seed germination or earlier, and for perennial plants before budburst.\nIn greenhouses, depending on the cladding material used, the and irradiances will differ from those outdoors. Irradiances of and are always somewhat lower than outdoors as the cladding materials and the structure of the greenhouse absorb part of the radiation.\nBe aware that even though the temperature may be adequate for growing plants in a greenhouse during the winter, light and especially irradiances are much lower than in the summer, even when high pressure sodium or metal halide lamps are used to increase levels. For this reason, in experiments with lamps the balance between and can become very different to that under natural conditions.\nOf course, if you are not interested in what happens under natural conditions but are researching the management of crops under cover, then you only have to make sure that your treatments match what can be achieved in commercial production systems.",

    "text": "12.8 Appendix: Calculating the radiation field under an array of lamps\nThis section includes code for calculating the radiation field under different arrays of lamps (Figures [fig:position:tubes] and [fig:position:tubes:square]). The algorithm is that in the BASIC program in Björn and Teramura (1993) with a few changes related to the density of grid points used, and the area of the grid for which the light field is calculated. The grid area is expanded as it is also important to assess the distance at which neighbouring arrays can be located. Please, see Björn and Teramura (1993) for the details of the algorithm. The algorithm assumes that there are no reflecting surfaces near the array, so it is better suited for simulating the light field under arrays of lamps located outdoors, than for those located in controlled environments.\nThe functions are in the R package ‘lamps’ which is available from the handbook web site. The following example also uses package ggplot2, available from CRAN (comprehensive R archive network, at http://cran.r-project.org/ and many mirror sites). The first example (Box [box:light:field:R]) is for calculating and plotting the radiation field under and array of fluorescent tubes, using mostly the defaults.

    "text": "13.1 Introduction\nBy applying the most constant growth conditions that we can in an experiment, we try to minimise uncontrolled variation in our measured plant data, even though this is not always achieved even with identical climate chamber protocols (Massonnet et al. 2010). However, by growing plants in stable controlled environments we will also induce differences in their response to any given stress, since natural variation in the outdoor climate contributes to plants’ ability to cope with stress. Plants grown in climate chambers are “softer” than plants grown in greenhouses, that are themselves “softer” than plants grown outdoors. This softness can be expressed as weaker stems, physically softer leaves with less developed cuticles, and a lessened ability to regulate their stomata.\nAny protected cultivation will invariably differ from natural outdoor conditions, and the relative importance of these differences in aspects of the climate will vary between controlled and natural environments. The most pronounced difference is the constancy of a created climate under protected cultivation—and the lack of wind and UV-B radiation! In experiments in greenhouses during the winter and in growth chambers, the amount of radiation received by plants will be far less than they get in summer outside when most plants are active. This is unrealistic, unless dealing with obligate shade species.",

    "section": "13.2 Greenhouses",
    "text": "13.2 Greenhouses\nGreenhouses come in many shapes and materials throughout the world. For plant production the cladding material can be either glass or plastic. Normal glass is opaque to UV-B and only expensive quartz glass allows UV-B to penetrate. The latter is used in only a few places where near-ambient UV-B radiation is considered important for ecophysiological research, but the vast majority of glasshouses provide no natural UV-B inside. The use of plastic opens several opportunities for choosing materials that are transparent to UV-B. Plastics are available as opaque and UV-transparent films that transmit &lt;1% or &gt;70% of the radiation &lt; 400 nm, respectively. They can be clear (transmitting 87–90% of PAR) or milky to diffuse the light (transmitting 85% of PAR). transparent films are yet primarily used for increasing the vegetable quality in horticultural production in warmer climates.\nThis chapter will by no means give complete instructions on how to manage the climate in a greenhouse, but we have gathered some information about possible technical solutions to various climate problems and some tips and tricks from personal experience. Greenhouses are available that provide different technical solutions for controlling the climate. In this section we will focus on glass greenhouses with fully automatic climate control regulated by a climate computer. The topic of how to apply from lamps has already been covered in section 8.2 on page .\n\n13.2.1 Temperature\nIt is technically easier to heat than to cool a greenhouse and it is therefore easier to maintain a stable temperature during cold times of the year than during warm weather. As long as the boiler and heating system are correctly set-up and able to cope with the maximum expected temperature difference between outside and inside, the temperature should remain close to the point set by the thermostat. The amount of variation around the set point will depend on the sensitivity of the on/off signal to the boiler from the thermostat that regulates the heating system. Where winters are particularly cold, some greenhouses require insulation screens to enable them to maintain e.g. air temperature.\nGreenhouses with conventional air conditioning are not common due to their high running costs, so cooling is normally done by passive ventilation, misting systems or fans with cooling pads. Passive cooling involves opening vents and/or using shade screens to decrease heat load from the sun. The temperature outside will naturally have a huge impact on the degree of cooling achieved by ventilation and, if the shade screens are used for cooling, it is important to keep a 10% gap between them to allow air circulation out of the greenhouse.\nIn a closed greenhouse in sunshine strong temperature gradients can be created. When the temperature at the floor level is ca. 25, it may be 30just 35 cm above the floor and &gt;50just under the ridge of the roof. A few horizontal fans with moderate rotation in the ceiling can mitigate the problem. Regardless if fans are used or not it is important that the climate sensors connected to the climate computer are placed close to the plants since the plants respond to the microclimate in the canopy, not the macroclimate somewhere else in the greenhouse. It is also crucial that the temperature sensor is shielded from direct heat radiation from the sun or lamps to ensure that the true air temperature is measured.\nWater-based cooling systems use the principle of evaporative cooling. As water evaporates, some sensible heat from the warm air is transferred to the water as latent heat during its vaporisation. These cooling systems work best in areas with low to moderate air humidity. Misting systems can decrease the air temperature by some in moderate humidity and can be constructed with or without fans. It is important that they create droplets that are small enough to evaporate completely before they have fallen down onto the plants. “Rain” under misting systems will drastically increase the risk of fungal disease on plants.\nFans with cooling pads regulate temperature using large industrial fans mounted in series with pads where water trickles down an enlarged surface (e.g. corrugated fibreboard, wood shavings or wheat straw), which enhance the area for evaporation. The change in latent heat in the evaporated water leads to a corresponding decrease in air temperature.\n\n\n13.2.2 Light\nGreenhouse conditions should mimic the outdoor conditions of the open landscape as much as possible. The light environment in a greenhouse is strongly dependent on how much shade is created by its structure. Modern greenhouses are constructed to keep shading to a minimum.\nThe amount of radiation received by the plants can be increased by using lamps and decreased by using shade screens but regardless of technical installations it will be difficult to create summer light conditions in a greenhouse during the winter in latitudes covering most of Europe. During the summer in Denmark daily integrals of PAR vary in the range of ca. 10–30 between rainy and sunny days inside a greenhouse without shade screens, while the values in mid-winter are 0.5–5 with some use of supplemental light until 22:00 h in the evening (Figure [fig:ppfd:greenhouse]).\n\n\n\n\nModern greenhouses have two or three screens for different purposes (shade, insulation, blackout) but in most greenhouses one shade screen can perform a dual function in insulation as well as shading radiation. The shade screen may also differentially remove part of the radiation, allowing the user to decide what fraction of the radiation load to remove up to the maximum shading with the screen fully closed. In many cases, the principal role of shade screens is to decrease the heat load from the sun, preventing the greenhouse from getting too hot, or as insulation screen during the cold season, but we should bear in mind that the light environment created by a medium-to-dense screen is comparable to that of an overcast day i.e. the PAR is decreased by 10–90%, depending on screen material.\nFor plants whose flowering is controlled by day length, blackout screens can be used to give short day treatments and incandescent bulbs (low red:far-red photon ratio) for night interruption to achieve long day treatments[^32]. Either a single pulse, or multiple pulses—e.g. 5 min per hour—can be used in practice. In this way flowering can either be induced or plants kept in a vegetative state for both short- or long-day plants. For the treatment to work, the blackout screens must provide completely black conditions without gaps, since phytochrome responds to extremely small amounts of light, and even small cracks between screens would be enough to interrupt the night length signal.\nDuring the winter season, supplemental light from lamps is needed for most species grown in greenhouses at high latitudes. Most greenhouses in these regions are supplied with high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps, which give a spectrum from blue to red but predominantly emit orange light (Figure [fig:HPS:greenhouse]). For photosynthesis, this spectrum is not optimal but when it is combined with natural daylight most plants grow without any problems. In research greenhouses, high-pressure lamps based on elements other than sodium are also used to give more “white” light. However, they are not used for plant production because of their lower energy efficiency than HPS lamps.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nLight-emitting diodes (LEDs) are currently being developed to provide greenhouse lighting. They come in many different colours, and can emit anything from a narrow to a broad range of wavelengths. For use in greenhouses, numerous small companies have developed various LED lamps but up to now (summer 2012) large companies like Philips and Osram have as yet only released LED modules for use in growth chambers and for interlighting rows of vegetable crops (long narrow LED units placed between rows of e.g. tomatoes and cucumbers grown in greenhouses). Top light, or “ordinary” greenhouse LED lamps, will require LEDs that are sufficiently efficient to emit enough radiance while incorporating cooling for their electronics. These two factors have to be included in the “budget” when the energy efficiency is calculated for new LED lamps compared to traditional HPS lamps. Both the energy efficiency and lifetime of LEDs will decrease if their electronics are overheated.\nResearch on the spectral distribution of LED lamps is focusing on red light (which requires the least energy to produce per photon) and how much additional blue or white light needs to be added for good plant growth. One basic problem with this approach is that the human eye is most sensitive to green and yellow and less so to blue and red light. Since the colour of leaves is based on reflected wavelengths, leaves that are only illuminated by blue and red light, which is efficiently absorbed by chlorophyll, will appear as dark objects. It may distort our judgments of plant health and nutritional status when making comparisons, since it is often manifested as yellow chlorosis or reddish coloration of the leaves. One would guess that the technical development of specific greenhouse lamps will lead to red enriched LED lamps with some blue and white (or green) LEDs to improve colour recognition.\nBeyond their spectral composition, the main difference between LED and HPS lamps is that the latter produce heat radiated in the direction of the plants while the former do not. This means that the leaf temperature will be higher under HPS lamps than under LED lamps. However, the electronics of the LEDs do become warm. When using only one row of low-efficiency LEDs, the metal mounts for the LED modules often provide enough heat sink to prevent them from over heating (which would otherwise decrease their efficiency), whereas high-efficiency LEDs require cooling. Most early LED illumination for greenhouses was water-cooled and this is one reason that its use in greenhouses has not yet been very widespread. Currently there are some high-power LED lamps available that are passively cooled by convection (Figure [fig:LEDs:greenhouse]). Some other LED lamps with passive cooling have been designed for research (Figure [fig:LEDs:greenhouse:Philips]) or with active cooling for production (Figure [fig:LEDs:greenhouse:Fionia]). The colour of the radiation emitted depends on the LEDs used, and there are currently two different approaches when designing LED lamps: (1) maximising radiation output with respect to electricity consumed, and (2) maximising plant yield and crop quality irrespective of irradiance per unit of electrical power consumed. Because of the present fast technical development of the LED technology we can expect to see numerous new LED products for plant growth on the market in the next couple of years. From the perspective of research into the effects of UV-B in nature, the best PAR sources are those with a spectrum similar to sunlight.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nThe light distribution in greenhouses can be enhanced by diffusing glass, diffusing plastic films or thin diffusing screens. These create a more even distribution of light and decrease the differences, such as light gradients or patchiness, that are otherwise created by shade from the structure. A resultant side effect of diffusers is enhanced growth of plants due to better penetration of light into the canopy (Markvart et al. 2010).\nCommercially-available climate computers are often connected to photometric (lux) sensors that measure light visible to humans (\\approx400–700 nm, see Box [box:photometric:quantities] on page ), whereas global:rad is measured radiometrically (, see Table [tab:Phys:Quants] on page ) in the range 400–1100 or 400–3000 nm to provide information for the energy-related control of greenhouses (primarily temperature). The latter is the correct way to measure irradiance linked to climate control; whereas visible light, related to photosynthesis and plant production, should be measured as PAR photon irradiance or PPFD (PPFD, , see Box [box:quantum:quantities] on page ) or PAR (energy) irradiance (). Modern climate computers can also be directly connected to PPFD sensors.\nWhen using supplemental light from various light sources extra care need to be taken on the choice of quantum sensor since most supplemental greenhouse lamps have a dis-continuous spectrum. Some cheaper quantum sensors do not cover the full spectral range 400–700 nm and the sensor may not cover the spectrum of red LED’s, which can peak close to a wavelength of 700 nm.\nOne should keep in mind, that moving an experiment from the field to a greenhouse does not make it independent of the outdoor season, since the UV-B dose should be balanced against the integrated daily PPFD if the experiment aims to mimic outdoor conditions. Daylight varies tremendously between winter and summer. Even with supplemental light the PPFD of a sunny winter day in Northern Europe will only correspond to an overcast day in the summer (Figure [fig:ppfd:greenhouse]). The contribution from lamps will be less than what is found in sunlight during the summer, even under long photoperiods (c.f. Figures [fig:ppfd:lamps] and [fig:ppfd:greenhouse]).\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nExcept for late successional species that ecologically are adapted to obligate shade, most plants will acclimate to the prevailing light conditions (Bazzaz and Carlson 1982). This means changing chloroplast architecture and the stoichiometry of the whole photosynthetic apparatus (Anderson, Chow, and Goodchild 1988) and thus also altering the light response of photosynthesis.\nMost experiments on light acclimation only discus the light environment in terms of “high light” or “low light”, regardless if it has been created as % of sunlight with permanent shade screens or as a certain PPFD in climate chambers. However, the light environment should be described by day length, maximum PPFD and integrated daily PPFD. Not much is known about which of the parameters of the light environment, actually trigger acclimation of photosynthesis. The three light parameters mentioned above have been investigated in tomato (Van den Boogaard et al. 2001), where the day length affected the chlorophyll concentration while the integrated daily PPFD affected the maximum rate of fixation at light saturation, independent of what the maximum PPFD was during the day.\nIf photosynthesis is being studied in greenhouses in relation to UV-B one should be aware of the effect that the seasonal changes in daylight has on the photosynthetic apparatus and therefore also on the growth of the plants, when comparing different experiments conducted at different times of the year.\n\n\n13.2.3 Air humidity\nAir humidity is difficult to regulate in greenhouses. If few plants are grown in a compartment the humidity tends to be low due to the large areas of potentially cold glass and concrete that act as dehumidifiers through condensation. If the leaf area index (LAI) is high, transpiration will make humidity correspondingly high despite condensation on the greenhouse surfaces.\nMisting systems can increase the humidity but it is important that they create mist, not rain. Rain or condensation on the plants will increase the risk of fungal disease in the experimental plants.\nThe humidity will be higher in highly insulated than in single-glass greenhouses, where some of the humidity will condense on the glass. High air humidity is decreased by opening the vents at the same time as turning on the heating system to increase the exchange of air with the outside. The effect of dehumidifying ventilation will depend on the outdoor weather conditions and on whether dry or moist air is entering the greenhouse.\nUsing traditional climate control, the air humidity is regulated as relative humidity (RH, %). The driving force of transpiration is the absolute gradient of water vapour from the intercellular spaces inside the leaf to the outside air, i.e. the water vapour pressure difference (, Pa). As the intercellular spaces are microscopic and the cell walls saturated with water it is assumed that the RH in the leaf is 100% at the given leaf temperature. Since the absolute content of water vapour in air of the same RH is strongly temperature dependent (Figure [fig:water:vapour]), the evaporative demand can differ greatly when temperature fluctuates in the greenhouse, even if RH is stable.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nIn modern climate computers a measured quantity equivalent to VPD (i.e. based on absolute difference in humidity, expressed as water mass concentration, instead of difference in partial pressure) can be used for humidity control, instead of RH. It is called delta-\\chi (\\Delta \\chi, , or sometimes simply delta-X) and is the water deficit from the saturated value, but expressed based on mass concentration instead of vapour pressure. Both VPD and \\Delta\\chi use saturated water vapour content based on air temperature as a reference. To be correct we need information about the canopy temperature to use VPD or \\Delta\\chi to estimate the true evaporative demand () as when the leaves are transpiring their temperature will be somewhat lower than the air temperature, due to evaporative cooling. The canopy temperature is not easily measured but in the context of climate control the approximation based of VPD or \\Delta\\chi still provides a better approximation to the true evaporative demand created by the atmosphere in the greenhouse than RH.\nMisting systems using ultrasonic humidifiers have been reported to also generate some hydrogen peroxide and may not be appropriate in research studies of plant growth (Arends et al. 1988). Although the evidence is not strong, one should be aware of this possible undesired effect.\nHowever, increasing air humidity in greenhouses by forced aerosolization of water (creating small droplets by water sprays, jets, ultrasonic nebulizers etc.) may cause different problems. These processes cause charge separation of water droplets and thus forming high concentrations of nano-sized ions, which can damage electronic equipment due to electrostatic deposition. The effects of the charged droplets on plants are not known. This effect is not seen if water is being evaporated directly from a water surface to water vapour e.g. by trickling water in fans with cooling pads.\n\n\n13.2.4 Elevated carbon dioxide concentration\nModern greenhouses have systems to supply elevated concentration to promote crop growth. There are several possible sources of that can be used: the three most common ones are liquid from a tank, combustion of natural gas for production and produced when burning fossil fuels for heat/power production, where the latter two require cleaning of the fumes to remove and .\nA major difference between elevated supplied in full-scale greenhouses compared to open-top chambers or FACE is that the greenhouse is not supplied continuously during daytime hours. Because of the vast volume of a greenhouse compartment it would be very expensive to supply elevated when the vents are open for temperature control. Therefore in traditional greenhouse climate control elevated is given only when the vents are closed or open by at most 5%. Ethylene contamination, which can significantly reduce plant growth, has been reported in some supplies and it should be removed by scrubbing if necessary (Morison and Gifford 1984).\nFurthermore the isotope composition may differ in liquid compared to natural air, which need to be checked if investigations include measurements of the ratio e.g. in relation to water balance, and when comparing with results in the literature.\n\n\n13.2.5 Growth substrates, irrigation and fertilization\nTransferring experiments indoors inevitably means growing the plants in pots. It is important to chose a growth substrate that has both good water holding and draining properties to meet the demand for water and oxygen for the root system. In the horticultural greenhouse industry peat mixtures are the most commonly used substrate in pots but also coco-peat (granulated husks of coconuts) is used. To ensure good aeration perlite or vermiculite is sometimes mixed into the substrate. Since the pot volume is limited the fluctuations in water content will be greater than in soil, as will be the fluctuations in soil temperature. In natural soil the temperature will be both more stable and lower than what it is in pots.\nThe pots are often of dark colour and they absorb heat radiation when exposed to sunlight. In commercial production the pot density is kept high enough to create shade between the pots and only the outer row of pots are potentially exposed to heat radiation from the sun. In experiments you often leave some space between the plants, not to have excessive shade between them. During sunny days without shade the pot temperature can easily increase to levels that are damaging to the root system and when knocking the soil/root out of the pot of border plants that has been exposed to direct sunlight it is not uncommon to see root death on the exposed side of the pot. The temperature of the nutrient solution/water also affects the root temperature. If the water is cold a growth retarding effect can be seen on the plants. More reflections on pot experiments are found in Passioura (2006) and a meta-analysis of the effect of pot size on plant growth in Poorter, Bühler, et al. (2012).\nSeveral types of watering systems exist but the most common ones are drip irrigation and ebb/flow systems. Drip irrigation is based on thin tubes supplying each pot with nutrient solution from a tank. In an ebb/flow system the nutrient solution it pumped up on the bench to 1–2 cm water depth and kept there for some minutes, before being drained off, back into the tank. This system recirculates the nutrient solution and with commercial nutrient/watering computers the composition is controlled by pH and electric conductivity (EC) of the solution, topping up with stock solution or an acid to keep the nutrient concentration and pH at desired level.\nIrrigation of the plants can be done by timer or on demand. In greenhouses plants will have different need for water dependent on the weather. If the irrigation is done by timer without adjustment for sunny or overcast weather there will be a risk that the plants are over-watered during dull days or water stressed on sunny days. Both stresses potentially affect the growth of the plants.\nWatering by demand can be done by experience or by weighing the plants and watering after a pre-determined water loss. Load cells can be mounted under ca. 0.5 m^2 watering trays or under a section of a greenhouse bench, triggering a pump in the tank with nutrient solution via a datalogger. Since plants that grow to maturity follow a sigmoid growth curve the watering needs to be adjusted accordingly during the experiment, to follow the demand.\n\n\n13.2.6 Data logging of microclimatic variables\nWhen working in greenhouses it is not enough to report the set points used for the most important climate parameters. The climate in a greenhouse needs to be measured and the observed values reported. The optimum arrangement is to have separate sensors recording the climate to those that are controlling the climate, but if this is not possible the ones connected to the climate computer can be used, if they are calibrated. Light irradiance, air temperature and humidity are the most important parameters to record, along with concentration if it is applied. Since the natural irradiance can fluctuate rapidly, it is important to have a high logging frequency, e.g. every minute. Furthermore, it is important that the temperature sensor is shielded from direct heat radiation from the sun and the lamps, while still being exposed to free air, e.g. in a ventilated box. For ideas on how to construct a radiation shield for measurement of air temperature refer to the design of weather stations (e.g. http://www.kippzonen.com, http://www.skyeinstruments.com and may others). There are several small dataloggers on the market, with built-in air temperature and humidity sensors in a plastic housing. They also have to be shielded from heat radiation when used in a greenhouse or climate chamber since the plastic housing gradually heats up and transfers the body temperature to the sensor—in climate chambers with metal halide lamps errors larger than 10have been observed when no shielding was used. Recommendations for sensors and frequency of data logging are compiled in Table [tab:growth:guidelines].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnits\nWhere to measure\n\nWhat to report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate chamber\nGreenhouse\n\n\n\nRadiation\nPPFD\n\nTop of the canopy in the centre of growing area (in greenhouses &gt; 1 sensor is preferred)\nStart, every 2 weeks and end of experiment\nn.a.\nMean (daytime) and s.d.

    "text": "13.4 Controlled environments\nIn controlled environments the spectral distribution of the light emitted by the lamps used is especially important since there is no contribution from natural light. A skewed spectrum can cause strange growth patterns in plants and many lamp types produce distinct emission bands, interrupted by bands of very low emission (Figure [fig:spectra:PAR:lamps]). Fluorescent tubes and HPS lamps, in particular, emit very little far-red and produce plants with very stunted growth, compared to lamps that create a continuous spectrum resembling sunlight (Hogewoning et al. 2010). However, lamps emitting a continuous spectrum can also create unexpected differences in plants compared to sunlight. An unpublished example is that of white cabbage grown in pots outdoors then moved into a climate chamber with metal halide bulbs (see Figure [fig:spectra:PAR:lamps]), which developed a distinct red coloration after a couple of hours at constant light.\nlamps emit some blue light providing a weak visual indicator that the lamp is turned on, but the contribution to the light environment will be minor in comparison to the overall from the main lamps used for . They also emit very small amounts of orange-red radiation.\nMost lamps presently used also emit a substantial amount of heat radiation. Some of this heat should be removed using a heat filter. The most efficient design to achieve this is to have the lamps in a separate, ventilated compartment in the ceiling, divided from the growth chamber by a transparent glass/plexi-glass sheet. Even so, it is important that the temperature sensor measuring air temperature in a climate chamber is shielded from the heat radiation from the lamps. Water is a good absorber of infra-red radiation, and sometimes a transparent tray with circulating water[^33] is used as a barrier between lamps and the plant compartment. Most lamp types (e.g. metal halide) used in climate chambers can only be turned on/off, not dimmed. To create different photon irradiances the lamps has to be turned on in different constellations. Even though daylight shows strong and fast variations in irradiance (Figure [fig:light:regime:clouds] on page ) the overall light pattern is bell shaped. To mimic natural light conditions a gradual or stepwise change during the morning/evening hours is preferred. If it is possible to get e.g. 600 from the lamps, a 14 h-long day will give an integrated of 30 , which corresponds to a sunny day in May in Denmark (Figures [fig:ppfd:greenhouse] and [fig:ppfd:lamps]). With the present development of the LED technology the first climate chambers with LED lighting have been introduced to the market, and one can expect that LEDs will be used extensivelly for controlled environments in the future. LEDs can be dimmed without any drastic changes in their spectral profile and the lack of heat radiation in the direction of the plants removes one complicating factor for lighting in climate chambers. Figure [fig:spectra:PAR:lamps] shows the photon emission spectra of some lamps used as PAR sources in controlled environments and greenhouses.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nIn climate chambers it is often possible to create a fast change between the day and night temperatures, though this is unnatural to plants. Under natural conditions a 5–10decrease in air temperature normally takes hours, allowing e.g. the membrane fluidity to follow. If the temperature drop between day and night is big and fast some plants may experience transient stress linked to membrane fluidity, which would not be the case if the change were slower. This is something to bear in mind, when designing the chamber climate. It can also increase the risk of fungal disease if the air humidity is high and the plants become damp, in the same way as in greenhouses.\nIf experiments are done at low or high temperatures there may be restrictions on how well humidity can be controlled. At low temperature there may be limitations on the capacity for dehumidification and at high temperatures it may not be possible to sufficiently moisten the air.\nNumerous plant species lose the ability to effectively regulate their stomata when grown at constant high humidity (ca. 70% RH at 20–25). To our knowledge, this has been observed in , , and . These plants lose their ability to regulate stomatal conductance when subsequently exposed to low air humidity e.g. if moved from the greenhouse to a laboratory for measurements of photosynthesis. In the worse case scenarios, the plants transpire to such an extent that small local spots of necrosis develop on the patch where gas exchange has been measured on the leaf. However, since results like these are considered as failed experiments such observations have not (to our knowledge) been scientifically published. Nevertheless, it is important to be aware of this potential problem when working with mesophytic leaves, i.e. “average” leaves that are adapted neither to dry nor to wet conditions, like the examples above.\nData logging of the climate is needed in controlled environments to catch irregularities and failings in the climate control. This is especially important to test for differences among chambers when the climate set points changes. The Committee on Controlled Environment Technology and Use under the USDA has issued recommendations for data logging of growth chamber climate, which are compiled, with some changes, in Tables [tab:growth:guidelines] and [tab:growth:envir:describing].\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nUnits\nWhat to report\n\n\n\n\nManufacturer\nn.a.\nName and address (n.a. for greenhouse)\n\n\nModel\nn.a.\nModel descriptor if available.

    "text": "13.5 Material issues in greenhouses and controlled environments\nA potentially problematic issue concerning materials in greenhouses and climate chambers relates to the use of different types of soft plastic materials. Plastics like cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate or PVC are stiff by nature. It is only when they are mixed with a softener i.e. a “plasticiser” that they become soft and flexible. The plasticisers may be different alkyl esters of phthalic acid. Some of these phthalates are phytotoxic, particularly butyl phthalate (DBP) and di-isobutyl phthalate (DIBP) (Hannay and Millar 1986; Millar and Hannay 1986). The phytotoxicity is evident as poor growth, chlorosis, necrosis and plant death. At regular intervals since the 1950’s there have been examples in the greenhouse industry and plant research facilities where new plastics have been introduced for different purposes, which have caused serious growth problems (Hardwick and Cole 1987). Many species are damaged by phthalates but species of Brassicaceae seem to be particularly sensitive. Past examples of products responsible for phytotoxic problems include plastic tunnels, water hoses, drip irrigation tubes, plastic plant pots, glazing strips (that seal between the glass and aluminium frames in the greenhouse construction), plastic insulation of electrical wires and plastic boots—the latter creating growth problems in a greenhouse outside a staff changing room. Many of these problems have been created when the recipes or composition of products already in use in a greenhouse have been changed by the manufacturer. Growth chambers require some fresh air inlet for the climate control. There is an example of poor growth and bleaching of plants in a climate chamber when the air inlet was close to the ventilation outlet of a chemistry laboratory. When the air inlet was moved 200 m away and supplied with a compressor, the problem disappeared.",

    "text": "13.6 Gas-exchange cuvettes and chambers\nMeasurement of photosynthesis through gas-exchange with present requires modifications of most standard equipment. Most gas-exchange cuvettes have windows that attenuate radiation. This means that most leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance measurements are done in the absence of radiation, even when done in sunlight. Stomata have been shown to respond to radiation (e.g. Eisinger et al. 2000), and at high irradiances the rate of photosynthesis can also be affected (see Rozema et al. 1997 for a consice review).\nFor example, the GFS-3000 system from Walz, can be ordered with cuvette windows made of quartz instead of normal glass. Some cuvettes for the LI-COR LI-6400 use a plastic film as a window, and it is possible to use an -transparent material. The cuvette for CIRAS-2 from PP Systems is delivered with Calflex heat filter glass as standard, but can easily be fitted with quartz glass for transmission on request.\nFrequently used light sources are tungsten-halogen lamps, which emit very little radiation, or light sources based on red LEDs in combination with blue or white LEDs, which do not emit any radiation.\nWhen designing experiments, especially when leaves or shoots are enclosed for more than a couple of minutes in a gas-exchange cuvette, one should be aware that the leaves or shoots may be in an unnatural light environment, even when measurements are done in full sunshine. To avoid surprises, always measure irradiance and especially spectral irradiance through the cuvette window, rather than outside the cuvette, if you want to describe the radiation environment during measurements.\nPlastic and rubber used for tubing have different properties of permeability to and water vapour, and absorption of water, which can lead to flawed gas-exchange data. These properties are listed in Long and Hällgren (1987).",

Some ecosystems like peat bogs get more easily damaged than others, but in most cases special precautions are needed whenever repeated access to plots is needed. The most common approach is to use catwalks made from wooden planks raised some centimetres above the ground. Sometimes when access is needed to the centre of the plots ladders are put temporarily, laying horizontally bridging two catwalks. Figure [fig:catwalks:Abisko] shows some examples from Abisko and Figure [fig:filters:photo:field1] on page shows an example from Ushuaia.\n\n \n\nNot only the spectrum, but also the temporal variation of irradiance differs between controlled environments and natural conditions. The temporal light regime depends on the position of the sun and on clouds (Figure [fig:light:regime:clouds]), and also on the vegetation itself (Figure [fig:light:regime:sapplings]). For experiments done in the field summaries of data from an in situ or nearby weather station should be used to describe the growing conditions. To assess the light environment at different locations in a forest understorey, hemispherical photographs taken with a fish-eye lens, can be used.

    "section": "13.8 Cultivation of aquatic plants",
    "text": "13.8 Cultivation of aquatic plants\nWhen designing experimental set ups for the cultivation of aquatic plants under full solar radiation (+ + ) or under a simulated natural radiation field (see section 8.4 on page ), the spectral transmission of the vessels or photobioreactors used must be accounted for as well as the absorbtion of radiation by the water, growth medium and the aquatic plants themselves (self shading). Most studies evaluating photosynthetic activity in algae have been conducted in -opaque incubators and this has consequently led to overestimation of their photosynthetic capacity, since radiation causes photoinhibition and photodamage in aquatic plants (Häder and Figueroa 1997; Villafañe et al. 2003; Bischof et al. 2006).\nThe most frequently used photobioreactors have a cylindrical shape and they can be transparent or opaque to radiation (Figure [fig:culture:systems], see section 8.4 on page ). Some photobioreactors are built from rigid plastic such as polycarbonate (PC), polymethylmethacrylate (PMM) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and others from flexible plastic such as cellulose acetate or polyethylene.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nThe aims of photobioreactor design are:\n\nhigh volumetric productivity (g l^{-1} d^{-1}),\nhigh productivity per unit area (g m^{-2} d^{-1})\nhigh cell concentration (g l^{-1})\nhigh efficiency in the conversion of light (g mol_\\mathrm{photons}^{-1})\nhigh biomass quality\nsustainable and reliable cultivation, and\nlow construction and operating costs.\n\nThe material for the photostage of the photobioreactors must have:\n\nhigh transparency,\nhigh mechanical strength,\nhigh durability (resistance to weathering),\nchemical stability\nease of cleaning, and\nlow cost.\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nSeaweeds can be also cultivated in large tanks (500–1000 l) made of materials such as polyethylene, glass-fibre-reinforced polyester or polypropylene—which all attenuate radiation (Figure [fig:large:tanks:photos]). Thus when and visible radiation are supplied by artificial lamps, they must be located above the open top of the tanks. Likewise when tanks receive natural solar radiation, direct:rad is available within the tank only at high solar elevation angles, whereas diffuse:rad predominates during the rest of the day. Large containers are considerably more expensive than other systems and require an ample water supply and frequent maintenance. Facilities originally designed for other purposes, e.g. biofiltration of fishpond effluents, are often used for the incubation of aquatic plants (Neori et al. 1996; Figueroa et al. 2006). These tanks can be placed outdoors under full solar radiation or enclosed inside a greenhouse.\nIn tanks, incident radiation is generally attenuated very rapidly and attenuation depends largely on algal density, the shape and volume of the tanks and the amount and type of particulate and dissolved material in the water. If we compare the irradiance at different depths in the water with different regions of the light-response curve of photosynthesis, we can see that PAR irradiance can be high enough to cause photoinhibition in the surface layer (Figure [fig:photosynthesis:in:tanks]). The smallest irradiance causing photoinhibition is denoted in the graph as Qh while the irradiance incident at the surface of the water is Q0. In the next layer below the surface, the incident irradiance is lower than Qh but higher than saturating irradiance for photosynthesis (Qs). About 80–90% of photons reach this layer of maximal production. The irradiance in the layer below, which is deeper than the layers above, is lower than saturating irradiance but higher than light-compensation-point irradiance (Qc)[^34]. Finally the irradiance in the deepest layer at the bottom of the tank is lower still Qc, this is considered to be a ‘dark’ layer (in general 70% of the volume of the tank). Thus, it is crucial that the algae are vigorously circulated through the tanks using air to maintain a light:dark regime adequate for growth, i.e. the algae move from the bottom of the tanks, where the tubes injecting the air are located, to the upper layers, where photon irradiance is higher.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nTo cultivate both fixed or free floating aquatic plants, the plants must receive air (with or without enrichment) in addition of light and nutrients. Air not only serves as a carbon source but also produces the turbulent environment needed to provide nutrients to the algae, which under a laminar regime would be less available to some of the algae leading to their starvation. Thus, the suitable movement of macrophytes within the tank results, not only in their adequate exposure to PAR and radiation, but also the provision of nutrition and gas exchange. Thus, the appropriate balance between the initial inoculum and the water volume should be accurately calculated. Due to circular movement of water within a tank, macrophytes are often exposed to variable light conditions or, when densities are high, to self-shading. The cultivation of subtidal seaweeds in outdoor tanks can cause bleaching or chronic photoinhibition because they are not normally exposed to high irradiances of . These effects of high irradiance can mask the effects of radiation. This can be avoided by the use of neutral shading screens that minimise the undesirable effects of excessive light, as exemplified in a tank cultivation of three seaweeds from the coast of Baja California (Cabello-Pasini, Aguirre-von-Wobeser, and Figueroa 2000). By neutral screens, we mean grey or black shade-cloth that has little or no effect on the radiation spectrum, attenuating all wavelengths by the same relative amount. When using more than one layer of shade-cloth, remember that the effect is multiplicative rather than additive. For example two layers of a cloth with a 50% transmittance each will yield a transmittance of approximately 25%.\nAs an example, in cultures of in semitransparent polyethylene tanks, the high algal biomass density caused a drastic reduction in the maximal average irradiance at 10 cm depth compared to that at the surface (Figueroa et al. 2008). At 10 cm depth, was reduced by about 87.5% at an algal density of 4 g l^{-1}, 89.5% at 6 g l^{-1} and 95% at 8 g l^{-1}. The attenuation of radiation was 94% at 4 g l^{-1}, 96% at 6 g l^{-1} and 99% at 8 g l^{-1}. radiation at noon was fully attenuated by an algal density of 4 g l^{-1} at 10 cm depth, while with this same algal density there was “complete darkness” (less than 0.1% of incident irradiance) at 25 cm depth.\nThe shape of the tank and the ratio of surface to volume (S:V) also have an effect on the hydrodynamics and the movement of the seaweeds (Figure [fig:culture:tanks:S:V]). Semicircular tanks of fibre glass (750 l) have better hydrodynamics, not only because they allow more water movement and a better distribution of the air bubbles in the tank, but also because of their higher S:V ratio (2.4 m^{-1}) than that of cylindric 1500 l tanks of semitransparent polyethylene (S:V = 1 m^{-1}) or 90 l (S:V = 2.2 m^{-1}).\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nAnother aspect of good experimental design is choosing the location of plants within the culture system, i.e. the merits of fixed- versus free-floating aquatic plants. Both fixed and free floating aquatic plants absorb radiation to differing extents depending on their pigment composition and the thickness of their tissue or thallus. Aquatic angiosperms can be anchored to both natural materials, such as stones, and artificial materials (rows, epoxy, etc.). Seaweeds are usually cultured in free floating systems where they are moved by the injection of air, although in nature they are fixed to different substrates. Not all species can be cultivated floating freely and in some cases this can alter their growth forms, transforming branched forms into a spherical forms. Morphological changes affect both bio-optical properties (i.e. including absorption) and nutrient assimilation which is higher in branched forms than spherical forms due to their higher surface:volume ratio (of both cells and the whole plant). Thus, in photobiological experiments, it is crucial to optimise both algal density and the light field—by using lamps located to one side (lateral position) or above the aquarium—so as to reduce or avoid self shading.\nMesocosms have been developed to recreate natural conditions as closely as possible on a small scale. They are generally used to study plankton communities, however, their use in aquatic macrophyte ecology is increasing. For example, floating mesocosms and mesocosms connected to land—e.g. attached to a platform or pier—have been developed (Figure [fig:floating:mesocosms]).\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nSeveral mesocosm studies have used ambient radiation supplemented with radiation from fluorescent lamps to simulate an increase in radiation due to ozone depletion. Two methodologies can be applied: (a) supplementing a fixed irradiance value (“square wave systems”), or (b) supplementing a fixed percentage of ambient irradiance (“modulated systems”) (C. Belzile et al. 1998; Claude Belzile et al. 2006). Modulated systems, which were originally developed for terrestrial plants (Caldwell et al. 1983), are better than square-wave systems for simulating predicted increases in radiation (Díaz et al. 2003, 2006). See section 8.2.6 on page .\nWhen using mesocosms, experimental designs must be as realistic as possible in simulating forcing factors as well as their variability. For example, when studying the effect of increased , experiments should be designed to reproduce diurnal variations in irradiance and episodic events such as passing clouds. Recently, experiments using mesocosms have been applied to evaluate the interactive effects on macrophytes of environmental shifts driven by climate changes (temperature, , radiation and nutrient availability). To mimic climate change conditions, Liboriussen et al. (2005) designed a flow-through mesocosm in a shallow lake which can also be applied to other aquatic ecosystems. Recently, a new automatically-operated system providing accurate simulations of the increases in radiation and temperature according to climate change scenarios has been developed (Nouguier et al. 2007). All these systems reproduce the sort of high degree of environmental variability inherent to aquatic systems.",
