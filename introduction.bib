These controls are necessary for adequate plant adjustment to the prevailing conditions, but at the same time they impose the need for sophisticated mechanisms to achieve adequate sensitivity towards signals and stability against noise. To cope with this challenge plants use multiple signals, multiple receptors even for the same signal and interactive signal transducers with multiple targets. Here we provide an overview of this multiplicity and its functional significance.},

  abstract     = {Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation is an intrinsic fraction of sunlight that plants perceive through the UVR8 photoreceptor. UVR8 is a homodimer in its ground state that monomerizes upon UV-B photon absorption via distinct tryptophan residues. Monomeric UVR8 competitively binds to the substrate binding site of COP1, thus inhibiting its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity against target proteins, which include transcriptional regulators such as HY5. The UVR8–COP1 interaction also leads to the destabilization of PIF bHLH factor family members. Additionally, UVR8 directly interacts with and inhibits the DNA binding of a different set of transcription factors. Each of these UVR8 signaling mechanisms initiates nuclear gene expression changes leading to UV-B-induced photomorphogenesis and acclimation. The two WD40-repeat proteins RUP1 and RUP2 provide negative feedback regulation and inactivate UVR8 by facilitating redimerization. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms of the UVR8 pathway from UV-B perception and signal transduction to gene expression changes and physiological UV-B responses.},

  abstract     = {Plants reorient their growth towards light to optimize photosynthetic light capture-a process known as phototropism. Phototropins are the photoreceptors essential for phototropic growth towards blue and {ultraviolet-A} {(UV-A)} light. Here we detail a phototropic response towards {UV-B} in etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings. We report that early differential growth is mediated by phototropins but clear phototropic bending to {UV-B} is maintained in phot1 phot2 double mutants. We further show that this phototropin-independent phototropic response to {UV-B} requires the {UV-B} photoreceptor {UVR8.} Broad {UV-B-mediated} repression of auxin-responsive genes suggests that {UVR8} regulates directional bending by affecting auxin signaling. Kinetic analysis shows that {UVR8-dependent} directional bending occurs later than the phototropin response. We conclude that plants may use the full short-wavelength spectrum of sunlight to efficiently reorient photosynthetic tissue with incoming light.},

  abstract     = {Phytochrome is a family of photoreceptors whose apoproteins are encoded by divergent genes, Three modes of action of phytochromes, very-low-fluence responses (VLFR), low-fluence responses (LFR) and high-irradiance responses (HIR), have been considered in the literature to define the quantitative relationship between response and predicted levels of the far-red light absorbing form of phytochrome. The results of recent experiments with phytochrome mutant and transgenic seedlings are consistent with the notion that phytochrome B, and in some cases other stable phytochromes, mediate LFR whereas phytochrome A mediates both VLFR and HIR, The mechanisms involved in phytochrome A inductive responses (VLFR) versus HIR appear to be different in some ways, However, VLFR, LFR and HIR can converge to control the transcriptional activity of a single gene promoter, The implications of these findings for the understanding of phytochrome phototransduction are discussed.
