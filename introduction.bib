These controls are necessary for adequate plant adjustment to the prevailing conditions, but at the same time they impose the need for sophisticated mechanisms to achieve adequate sensitivity towards signals and stability against noise. To cope with this challenge plants use multiple signals, multiple receptors even for the same signal and interactive signal transducers with multiple targets. Here we provide an overview of this multiplicity and its functional significance.},

  abstract     = {Plants reorient their growth towards light to optimize photosynthetic light capture-a process known as phototropism. Phototropins are the photoreceptors essential for phototropic growth towards blue and {ultraviolet-A} {(UV-A)} light. Here we detail a phototropic response towards {UV-B} in etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings. We report that early differential growth is mediated by phototropins but clear phototropic bending to {UV-B} is maintained in phot1 phot2 double mutants. We further show that this phototropin-independent phototropic response to {UV-B} requires the {UV-B} photoreceptor {UVR8.} Broad {UV-B-mediated} repression of auxin-responsive genes suggests that {UVR8} regulates directional bending by affecting auxin signaling. Kinetic analysis shows that {UVR8-dependent} directional bending occurs later than the phototropin response. We conclude that plants may use the full short-wavelength spectrum of sunlight to efficiently reorient photosynthetic tissue with incoming light.},

  abstract     = {Phytochrome is a family of photoreceptors whose apoproteins are encoded by divergent genes, Three modes of action of phytochromes, very-low-fluence responses (VLFR), low-fluence responses (LFR) and high-irradiance responses (HIR), have been considered in the literature to define the quantitative relationship between response and predicted levels of the far-red light absorbing form of phytochrome. The results of recent experiments with phytochrome mutant and transgenic seedlings are consistent with the notion that phytochrome B, and in some cases other stable phytochromes, mediate LFR whereas phytochrome A mediates both VLFR and HIR, The mechanisms involved in phytochrome A inductive responses (VLFR) versus HIR appear to be different in some ways, However, VLFR, LFR and HIR can converge to control the transcriptional activity of a single gene promoter, The implications of these findings for the understanding of phytochrome phototransduction are discussed.

  abstract  = {Plants are limited in their ability to choose their neighbours, but they are able to orchestrate a wide spectrum of rational competitive behaviours that increase their prospects to prevail under various ecological settings. Through the perception of neighbours, plants are able to anticipate probable competitive interactions and modify their competitive behaviours to maximize their long-term gains. Specifically, plants can minimize competitive encounters by avoiding their neighbours; maximize their competitive effects by aggressively confronting their neighbours; or tolerate the competitive effects of their neighbours. However, the adaptive values of these non-mutually exclusive options are expected to depend strongly on the plants' evolutionary background and to change dynamically according to their past development, and relative sizes and vigour. Additionally, the magnitude of competitive responsiveness is expected to be positively correlated with the reliability of the environmental information regarding the expected competitive interactions and the expected time left for further plastic modifications. Concurrent competition over external and internal resources and morphogenetic signals may enable some plants to increase their efficiency and external competitive performance by discriminately allocating limited resources to their more promising organs at the expense of failing or less successful organs.},

  abstract         = {In plants, secondary metabolites change in response to environmental conditions. These changes co-regulate resilience to stressful environmental conditions, plant growth and development, and interactions between plants and the wider ecosystem, while also affecting soil carbon storage and atmospheric and climatic conditions. The objective of this study was to determine the association between {UV} exposure and the contents of key metabolites, including amino acids, phenolics, flavonoids, terpenoids, carotenoids, tocopherols, and phytosterols. Mentha spicata plantlets were grown in tissue culture boxes for 30 days and then exposed to a low dose of broadband {UV}-B (291–315 nm; 2.8 {kJm}−2 biologically effective {UV}) enriched light for eight days. Metabolite contents were quantified either immediately after the final {UV} exposure, or after seven days of recovery under photosynthetically active radiation. It was found that {UV} promoted the production of flavonoids (1.8-fold) ahead of phenolic acids (unchanged). Furthermore, the majority of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, constituents of valuable mint essential oil, were significantly increased through {UV} treatment (up to 90-fold for α-linalool). In contrast, the contents of carotenoids and tocopherols did not increase following {UV} exposure. A comparison between plants sampled immediately after {UV} exposure and after seven days of recovery showed that there was an overall increase in the content of carotenoids, mono- and sesquiterpenes, phenolics, and amino acids following recovery, while the contents of sterols and tocopherols decreased. These {UV}-induced changes in metabolite profile may have important consequences for agriculture, ecology, and even the global climate, and they also provide an exciting opportunity to enhance crop value, facilitating the development of improved products with higher levels of essential oils and added benefits of enhanced flavour, colour, and bioactive content.},

  abstract            = {An investigation was made to determine the effect on plants of removing definite regions of the spectrum in the blue-violet end. Several widely different varieties of plants were grown in five separate greenhouses so constructed that practically all conditions except the quality of light could be kept the same in all houses. House 1 transmitted all wave lengths from the red end to 312 ??; house 2, all wave lengths to 296 ??; house 3 eliminated only ultra-violet rays; house 4 eliminated all rays shorter than 472 ??; and house 5 eliminated all wave lengths shorter than 529 ??. General observations were made on vegetative vigor, flowering, and fruiting. The height of all plants was measured weekly. Chemical analyses and microchemical tests were made, and anatomical changes were followed in some cases. The following results were obtained: 1. When plants were grown in daylight from which all wave lengths shorter than 529 ?? were eliminated, they developed the following characteristics as compared with plants grown in the entire spectrum of daylight: (a) An increased rate of elongation of the stem of all species during the first two or three weeks' growth; a greater final height in soybeans, tomatoes, four o'clocks, and coleus, but a decided decrease in height in sunflowers, petunia, buckwheat, and Sudan grass. (b) A considerable decrease in thickness of stems. (c) A reduction in the number of branches or side shoots. (d) A general curling or rolling of leaves. (e) Good development of chlorophyll, but a reduction in anthocyanin of leaves and flowers. (f) Less differentiation of stem and leaf tissues, less compact and thinner-walled cells, and a reduction in strengthening tissues. (g) Considerable delay in time of flowering and a reduction in the number of flowers produced. (h) Very weak development of seeds, fruits, and general storage organs. (i) Decrease in fresh weight and dry weight and an increase in percentage of moisture. (j) Considerable decrease in starch and total carbohydrates, and generally an increase in total nitrogen; often an increase in soluble nitrogen compounds. The degree to which these different effects were produced varied with different species, but all species, aside from the abundance of chlorophyll, had an etiolated appearance. 2. When all wave lengths shorter than 472 ?? were removed, the same effects were produced as listed above, but to a somewhat lesser degree. 3. When only ultra-violet rays were eliminated, none of the foregoing results were obtained with any of the plants used, although there was a small increase in length of stems in all species except buckwheat, as compared with plants receiving these rays. Tomatoes, petunias, Sudan grass, and sunflowers bloomed somewhat earlier than they did under any other conditions. In general, there was very little difference between plants that received all the rays of the spectrum of daylight and those from which only ultra-violet rays were eliminated. The results obtained with plants from which all wave lengths shorter than 529 ?? or 427 ?? were eliminated are somewhat similar to those obtained when plants are grown under greatly reduced light intensity. That light intensity was not an important factor in the present experiment is proved by the fact that normal, vigorous growth was obtained when the plants received the full spectrum of daylight at an intensity that was at all times lower than that of the house in which all wave lengths shorter than 427 ?? were removed and only slightly greater than that of the house in which wave lengths shorter than 529 ?? were eliminated. The results as a whole indicate that, while ultra-violet rays are not indispensable, the blue-violet end of the spectrum is necessary for normal vigorous growth of plants.},

  abstract = {Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation is an intrinsic fraction of sunlight that plants perceive through the UVR8 photoreceptor. UVR8 is a homodimer in its ground state that monomerizes upon UV-B photon absorption via distinct tryptophan residues. Monomeric UVR8 competitively binds to the substrate binding site of COP1, thus inhibiting its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity against target proteins, which include transcriptional regulators such as HY5. The UVR8–COP1 interaction also leads to the destabilization of PIF bHLH factor family members. Additionally, UVR8 directly interacts with and inhibits the DNA binding of a different set of transcription factors. Each of these UVR8 signaling mechanisms initiates nuclear gene expression changes leading to UV-B-induced photomorphogenesis and acclimation. The two WD40-repeat proteins RUP1 and RUP2 provide negative feedback regulation and inactivate UVR8 by facilitating redimerization. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms of the UVR8 pathway from UV-B perception and signal transduction to gene expression changes and physiological UV-B responses.},

  abstract  = {BackgroundPhototropism is the response a plant exhibits when it is faced with a directional blue light stimulus. Though a seemingly simple differential cell elongation response within a responding tissue that results in organ curvature, phototropism is regulated through a complex set of signal perception and transduction events that move from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. In nature phototropism is one of several plant responses that have evolved to optimize photosynthesis and growth.ObjectiveIn the present work we will review the state of the field with respect to the molecules and mechanisms associated with phototropism in land plants.MethodsA systematic literature search was done to identify relevant advances in the field. Though we tried to focus on literature within the past decade (1998-present), we have discussed and cited older literature where appropriate because of context or its significant impact to the present field. Several previous review articles are also cited where appropriate and readers should seek those out.ResultsA total of 199 articles are cited that fulfill the criteria listed above.ConclusionsThough important numerous and significant advances have been made in our understanding of the molecular, biochemical, cell biological and physiologic mechanisms underlying phototropism in land plants over the past decade, there are many remaining unanswered questions. The future is indeed bright for researchers in the field and we look forward to the next decade worth of discoveries.},
