## Research on plant responses to ultraviolet radiation {#sec:plants:UVB}

Plants are exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation in their natural habitats. The amount and quality of radiation they are exposed to depends on the time of the year, the latitude, the elevation, position in the canopy, clouds and aerosols, and for aquatic plants the depth, solutes and particles contained in the water (see sections [1.4](#sec:solar:radiation){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:solar:radiation"} and [1.6](#sec:UV:aquatic){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:UV:aquatic"}). Ultraviolet radiation is consequently a carrier of information about the environment of plants. However, when exposed to enhanced doses of radiation or radiation of short wavelengths, plants can be damaged. When exposed to small doses of radiation plants respond by a mechanism involving the perception of the radiation through a photoreceptor called UVR8 [@Jenkins2009b; @Rizzini2011; @Wu2011; @Christie2012; @DiWu2012; @Heijde2012]. This protein behaves as a pigment at the top of a transduction chain that regulates gene expression. Several genes have been identified as regulated by radiation perceived through UVR8. Some are related to the metabolism of phenolic compounds and are involved in the accumulation of these metabolites.\[\^1\] However, these are not the only genes regulated by UVR8. Genes related to hormone metabolism are also affected, and this could be one of the mechanisms for photomorphogenesis by radiation, for example an increase in leaf thickness or reduction in height of plants. Morphological effects of mediated by UVR8 have been described [@Wargent2009b].

The irradiance of in sunlight is larger than the irradiance of and plants also have photoreceptors that absorb both radiation and blue light. The best studied of these photoreceptors are cryptochromes and phototropins. Cryptochromes are involved in many photomorphogenic responses, including the accumulation of pigments. Phototropins are well known for their role in plant movements such as stomatal opening in blue light and the movement of chloroplasts [see @Christie2007; @Shimazaki2007; @Moeglich2010 for recent reviews].

The balance between the different wavebands, , and (photosynthetically active radiation, 400--700 nm), has a big influence on the effect of radiation on plants. Unrealistically low levels of radiation and enhance the effects of [e.g. @Caldwell1994c]. One reason for this is that radiation is required for photoreactivation, the repair of DNA damage in the light.

From the 1970's until the 1990's the main interest in research on the effects of on plants and other organisms was generated by the increase in ambient exposure caused by ozone depletion in the stratosphere [e.g. @Caldwell1971; @Caldwell1989; @Tevini1993; @Caldwell1994b]. This led to many studies on the effects of increased radiation, both outdoors, in greenhouses and in controlled environments. Frequently the results obtained in outdoor experiments differed from those obtained indoors. This lead to the realization that it is important to use realistic experimental conditions with respect to radiation and its ratio compared to other bands of the solar spectrum. Interactions of responses to radiation with other environmental factors like availability of mineral nutrients, water and temperature, were also uncovered. Effects on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems of ozone depletion, and the concomitant increase in radiation, have been periodically reviewed in @UNEP2011 [and earlier reports]. These reports include chapters on terrestrial ecosystems [@Ballare2011] and aquatic ecosystems [@Hader2011].

From the 1990's onwards, the interest in the study of the effects of normal (i.e.Â without stratospheric ozone depletion), as opposed to enhanced radiation increased markedly [e.g. @Paul2001; @Aphalo2003; @Jansen2012]. This was in part due to the realization that even low exposures elicit plant responses, and that these are important for the acclimation of plants to their normal growth environment. Furthermore, as these effects were characterized, interest developed in their possible applications in agriculture and especially horticulture [e.g. @Paul2005].

A further subject of current interest is the enhanced release of greenhouse gases from green and dead biomass caused by action of radiation on pectins [e.g. @Messenger2009; @Bloom2010]. Another long-standing subject of research are the direct and indirect effects of solar radiation on litter decomposition [e.g. @Newsham1997a; @Newsham2001; @Austin2010].

To be able to obtain reliable results from experiments on the effects of radiation on plants, there are many different problems that need to be addressed. This requires background knowledge of both photobiology, radiation physics, and climatology.

## Visible and near-infrared radiation 

Responses to UV radiation depend on the prevailing spectrum and irradiance of viisble and near infrared radiation. UVR8 and cryptochrome photoreceptors reciprocally modulate their activity at the signalling level through COP1 and BES mediated intereactions. Further downstream HY5 and PIFs mediated signalling depends on these two photoreceptors but also on the phytochromes. Furthermore, CRYs and PHYs, control responses affecting optical properties and display of leaves, that modify the sensitivity to UV radiation by attenuating it or reducing its interception. Thus, current understanding of plant photomorphogenesis indicates that a broader perspective is needed in the study of plants' responses to sunlight and shadelight.

## The role of time and timing

The importance of photoperiodism in some plants' responses has been recognised for a long time. However, recent progress has shown that not only photoperiodic and photosynthesis responses but also photomorphogenic responses depend on the time of day. Furthermore, even if in its infancy, the study of responses to pulsed light has shown that phoreceptor depedent responses are not simply dependent on the average light conditions during the photoperiod, but instead, temporal intergration of cues is far more complex than that. Time is also important with respect to the developmental stage and previously experienced environmental conditions (a life-time memory) and even in some cases previous generations (maternal effects).

## Scope of this second edition {#sec:photobio:principles}

Considering this new understanding, a book purely on methods for research on ultraviolet radiation, would have too narrow a scope, even for practitioners of such research. It makes little sense to study plant responses to UV radiation as an isolated field when we know that several fundamental interactions exist between responses to UV, VIS and NIR radiation. That separate research communities have focused on UV and VIS-NIR plant responses feels nowadays like a historical accident, that to some extent several currently active research groups have already bridged.

Thus, for this second edition, we have broadened the scope to include a wider range of wavelengths (\$280--900\\,\\mathrm{nm\]\$). We have however, avoided overlap with other existing publications by excluding, at least initially, methods for the measurement of photosynthesis or plant growth and chemical/biochemical methods used in the laboratory.
