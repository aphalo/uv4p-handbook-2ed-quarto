  abstract  = {Far red light (FR)-treated plants showed low chlorophyll content and erect leaves, but higher leaf area and plant dry weight. Differences in area expansion were related to the late phase of leaf growth and were due, at least in part, to larger cells in FR-treated plants. Effects on length/width ratio, specific leaf area, net assimilation rate, shoot/root ratio and leaf number were small or non-existent. It is suggested that the lower chlorophyll content in FR-treated plants was not a consequence of scarcity of assimilates.},

  abstract  = {Use of leaf meters to provide an instantaneous assessment of leaf chlorophyll has become common, but calibration of meter output into direct units of leaf chlorophyll concentration has been difficult and an understanding of the relationship between these two parameters has remained elusive. We examined the correlation of soybean {(Glycine} max) and maize {(Zea} mays L.) leaf chlorophyll concentration, as measured by organic extraction and spectrophotometric analysis, with output {(M)} of the Minolta {SPAD-502} leaf chlorophyll meter. The relationship is non-linear and can be described by the equation chlorophyll ({\^{I}}$\sfrac{1}{4}$mol {m{\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}{\textquoteright}2)=10(M0.265),} r2=0.94. Use of such an exponential equation is theoretically justified and forces a more appropriate fit to a limited data set than polynomial equations. The exact relationship will vary from meter to meter, but will be similar and can be readily determined by empirical methods. The ability to rapidly determine leaf chlorophyll concentrations by use of the calibration method reported herein should be useful in studies on photosynthesis and crop physiology.},
