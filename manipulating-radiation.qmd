## Safety considerations {#sec:safety}

### Risks related to sunlight exposure

When working in field experiments, workers and researchers are exposed
to sunlight as in any other outdoor activity. To avoid health hazards
adequate protection should be used, either in the form of clothing or
sun-blocking lotions. In some cases, for example when there is strong
reflection of radiation by water, sand or snow-covered surfaces, eye
protection in the form of sunglasses or goggles should be used.

A common and simple parameter of the UV radiation level outdoors is the
index, which was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO)
including recommended protection [@whouv02]. The index is used for
example in weather forecasts in integer numbers from 1 to 11+,
representing the exposure from low to extreme. [^14]

### Risks related to the use of UV lamps

Lamps emitting and create a higher risk of eye damage than sunlight
because when radiation is not accompanied by strong visible light the
eye pupils remain wide open. Also many lamps emit , which is not present
in sunlight at ground level and is more damaging than . It is important
to use goggles to protect the eyes not only from radiation from the
front but also from the sides of the face. It is important to ensure
that the goggles used are designed to protect from radiation, rather
than just from the impact of flying particles. The skin should also be
well protected, because in the same way as for plants, the effect of -B
on humans is enhanced under low visible light irradiance by the low rate
of photoreactivation (light-driven repair of DNA damage).

Locations where lamps are in use should have visibly located warning
signs. Although there is no standardized symbol for radiation hazard,
the warning symbol for optical radiation (Figure
[\[fig:warning:optical\]](#fig:warning:optical){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:warning:optical"}) accompanied by the text 'UV radiation'
can be used. Additional text, 'protect eyes and skin' or 'do not look
directly at light source' can be added. Access to outdoor experiments
should be restricted by fences with locked gates, and by locking access
doors to greenhouses, controlled environment rooms and cabinets. This is
to prevent exposure of people who are unaware of the risks involved.
Everybody with access to the area should be informed of risks, and
trained to use the protection and work procedures required to mitigate
them.

Lamps also pose risks unrelated to radiation. Fluorescent tubes contain
mercury and should disposed of as hazardous waste. The glass envelope of
lamps is fragile, and can cause injuries if it breaks. Xenon-arc lamps
also present a relatively high risk of explosion, goggles and other face
and body protection should be used. This risk is caused by the high
pressure inside this type of lamp and is present irrespective of the
xenon-arc lamps being on or off.

Lasers, can easily produce injuries, and should be handled with great
care. Even the very low power laser pointers used during lectures are
capable of injuring the eye if pointed towards the audience. As with
light sources, access to any type of laser should be restricted to
trained users, and eye protection should be worn to match the wavelength
emitted by each particular laser. Recommendations relating to warning
signs, given above, apply equally to lasers and UV lamps.

### Risks related to electrical power

Using mains power for either instruments or lamps, involves a risk of
electric shock and this is especially true in humid conditions and
outdoors. All components, like connectors, enclosures, and switches,
should have an IP rating[^15] and any other codes required for their use
in a particular environment. When using mains power in a room where
there is water, it is usually a requirement to have grounded mains
sockets protected with residual current devices (RCD). These sense the
current imbalance in the power line caused by a current leak to ground,
for example caused by the accidental flow of current through the body of
an operator. When this residual current is sensed, the device trips and
disconnects power in a few milliseconds so preventing serious injury.
RCDs and earth grounding should be regularly tested. Never use an
electrical device that has a grounded plug in a mains socket lacking
ground contacts because this will create a risk of electrocution and in
addition may negatively affect the functioning of measuring instruments.

### Safety regulations and recommendations

The EU directive 2006/25/EC about protecting workers from optical
radiation can be found at
<http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:114:0038:0059:EN:PDF>.
This directive does not apply to solar radiation. It gives maximum
allowed levels of exposure from artificial optical radiation sources and
other requirements on how to achieve these and the monitoring of workers
health. Britain's Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has produced a guide
on how to apply this directive (not approved yet by EU), that can be
found at <http://www.hse.gov.uk/radiation/nonionising/optical.htm>. At
this address, there is also information on sun exposure indicating that
'UV radiation should be considered an occupational hazard for people who
work outdoors'. The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued general
recommendations about protection from the sun, which can be found at
<http://www.who.int/uv/sun_protection/en/>.

## Artificial sources of UV radiation {#sec:UV:radiation:sources}

### Lamps {#sec:lamps}

#### Fluorescent lamps and tubes {#sec:fluorescent:tubes}

Fluorescent lamps and tubes are low pressure mercury vapour lamps. The
mercury vapour emits radiation at specific spectral lines, mostly in the
UV region of the spectrum. Except for the case of germicidal lamps the
inside of the glass tube is coated with a layer of 'phosphor'[^16] which
absorbs UV radiation and re-emits the energy as fluorescence, at longer
wavelengths, either as , , or visible radiation. There are even some
fluorescent tubes producing far-red radiation around 750 nm. For
environmental studies we are interested in and emitting lamps. These
lamps emit across a rather broad wavelength band, and have several minor
secondary peaks in the and visible regions. Figure
[\[fig:TL12:UVB313:UVA340\]](#fig:TL12:UVB313:UVA340){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:TL12:UVB313:UVA340"} shows the emission spectra of some
UV lamps.

::: figure*
![image](figures/fig_UV_lamps_facets.pdf){width="0.8\\myfigwidth"}
:::

It should be remembered when designing experiments that lamps should be
always filtered with cellulose diacetate film or some other material to
remove , otherwise the effects observed will not be only due to but also
to radiation. The emission of radiation might look small in energy terms
but, being very effective in eliciting biological effects, it is capable
of completely distorting the apparent response of plants and other
organisms to radiation in an experiment. In the case of lamps, both and
radiation should be removed by filtration.

Ultraviolet emitting fluorescent lamps also emit a small amount of
visible radiation, even in the red and orange regions of the spectrum.
This should not be forgotten when using these lamps as the only source
of radiation. For example the very small amount of red-orange light can
be enough to enhance germination of silver birch seeds in Petri dishes
when irradiated with lamps (Pedro J. Aphalo, unpublished data).

The most commonly used and lamps are 1200 mm-long tubes, rated at 40 W
of electrical power. These lamps are sold for materials testing (Q-Panel
UVB-313 and UVB-340, Q-Labs Inc., Farnworth, England) and for medical
use (Philips TL-40 W12, and TL-40 W 01, Philips, Amsterdam, The
Netherlands). The second of these lamp types from Philips emits over a
very narrow peak, and are not suited for simulating ozone depletion, but
might be useful when the aim is not to simulate solar radiation. There
are also other lamp types available, for example small-sized compact
fluorescent lamps such as PL-S 9W 01 from Philips.

Using fluorescent lamps requires some additional equipment (Figure
[\[fig:fluorescent:tube\]](#fig:fluorescent:tube){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:fluorescent:tube"}). The main component is a "ballast"
which limits the current through the lamp. Traditional ballasts are
electromagnetic, comprising a coil wound on a ferrous core, and require
one more component, a 'starter' for turning on the lamps. Lamps driven
by such ballasts run at power-line frequency, 50 Hz in Europe and 60 Hz
in USA, causing emission to flicker in time. This flicker is not visible
to humans, but is visible to some insects. The modern alternatives are
electronic ballasts driving the lamps at high frequency (in the order of
50--100 kHz) which together with the latency of the phosphor yields an
almost constant radiation output from the lamps. Consequently, we
recommend the use of high frequency ballasts to avoid artifacts.
Electronic ballasts do not require starters.

::: figure*
![image](figures/Fluorescent_Light.pdf){width="0.8\\myfigwidth"}
:::

Some types of electronic ballasts are dimming ballasts , allowing the
adjustment of lamp output from full power down to a
ballast-type-specific low value, usually somewhere between 1 and 10% of
full power. Dimming of lamp output can also be achieved using
electromagnetic ballasts and phase-angle dimming controllers but these
enhance the visible flicker of the lamps. Some ballasts are designed for
newer T8 (thin, 26 mm diameter) tubes rather than the old-fashioned T12
(thick, 38 mm diameter) tubes used for most lamps, which may cause some
problems with dimming, and affect the lowest power level achievable.
Dimming ballasts are controlled digitally (for example DSI system for
Tridonic PCA 1/38 T8 ECO, Tridonic GmbH & Co KG, Dornbirn, Austria) or
by a direct current voltage signal (for example 1--10 V for Quicktronic
HF 1X36/230-240 DIM UNV1, Osram, Munich, Germany). Dimming ballasts can
be useful for adjusting doses for different treatments, or when building
modulated supplementation systems (see section
[8.2.6](#sec:modulated){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:modulated"}
on page ).

Radiation output from fluorescent lamps varies markedly with ambient
temperature as shown in Figure
[\[fig:UV:lamp:temperature\]](#fig:UV:lamp:temperature){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:UV:lamp:temperature"}. The data in this figure were
obtained by varying the temperature in a growth chamber where the lamps
were located, and measuring the spectral irradiance with a
spectroradiometer maintained at near constant temperature outside the
chamber. Only the optical fibre entered the chamber through an
instrumentation port. In non-modulated systems, and in experiments with
treatments at different temperatures this should be taken into account
and the irradiance from lamps should always be measured at the same
temperature as during use of the lamps in the experiments. When the
ambient temperature fluctuates, the lamp output should be measured
continuously, or at least at a range of temperatures and irradiances
estimated from a continuous record of temperature.

::: figure*
![image](figures/fig_lamp_temp.pdf){width="0.8\\myfigwidth"}
:::

irradiance should never be adjusted by using different plant to lamp
distances in different treatments. Changing the distance modifies the
shading effect of lamp frames, and even small differences in can create
spurious differences between treatments [see @Flint2009 for details].
Furthermore, it is essential to have controls both under frames with
unenergised lamps and also under frames with energized lamps but
filtered with polyester film to remove the , as the only difference
between and non-treatments should be the irradiance of [see
@Newsham1996a]. If we want to assess the effect of shading by lamp
frames alone an *additional* control with no lamp frames could be added
to an experiment.

Fluorescent tubes are normally held on metal frames, and each frame
supports several lamps. Because these tubes are long and narrow, using
single tubes would provide a very uneven irradiance field. Care should
be taken when choosing the spacing of the tubes, and the vertical
distance between the tubes and plants. The model of @Bjorn1993a can be
used to simulate the spatial distribution of irradiance or fluence rate
under such an array of lamps (for a reimplementation of the model as an
R package see section [8.8](#sec:calc:light:field){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:calc:light:field"} on page ). Figure
[\[fig:position:tubes\]](#fig:position:tubes){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:position:tubes"} shows the results of six such
simulations, three for tubes evenly distributed along the frame
('equidistant') and three for tubes arranged following the projection on
a plane of what would be equidistant distribution around the perimeter
of a half circle ('cosine' pattern). The closer together the contour
lines are, the steeper the change in irradiance. The examples in Figure
[\[fig:position:tubes\]](#fig:position:tubes){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:position:tubes"} are for irradiance, and these results do
not apply to fluence rate. For each size and number of lamps and size of
frames, it should be possible to optimize either the evenness of
irradiance or of fluence rate by means of the model (Figure
[\[fig:position:tubes:square\]](#fig:position:tubes:square){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:position:tubes:square"}). The unevenness of the radiation
field should be taken into account when deciding where to the place
plants, and also when measuring exposures under the frames.

When using UV lamps to supplement solar radiation, shading by the lamps
and their supporting structures can become a problem. This is discussed
in section [9.10.3](#sec:enhancement:errors){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:enhancement:errors"} on page in relation to effective
doses and enhancement errors.

#### Xenon arc lamps {#sec:xenon}

Xenon arc lamps are specialised light sources that produce intense
visible and UV radiation from an electric discharge in high pressure
xenon gas. The lamps comprise tungsten electrodes inside a quartz
envelope and produce an intense plasma ball at the cathode at
6000--6500 K temperature generating a spectral output throughout the
visible and UV (Figure
[\[fig:xenon:lamp:spectrum\]](#fig:xenon:lamp:spectrum){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:xenon:lamp:spectrum"}). Xenon arc lamps must be operated
in a fully enclosed housing (Figure
[\[fig:xenon:lamp:photo\]](#fig:xenon:lamp:photo){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:xenon:lamp:photo"}) that usually provides mirrors and
focussing adjustments, electrical ignition and ventilation to cool the
lamp. Xenon arcs provide intense point sources but with careful
operation and adjustment are sometimes useful for experiments in
photobiology. They are extremely strong sources and have a very high
heat output in the infra-red waveband. This heat output typically
requires their use with a water filter and/or a dichroic mirror
reflector to reduce heating if used in experiments with plant material.
A dichroic mirror transmits infra-red onto a heat sink and reflects only
the required waveband (e.g. UV radiation) onto the target. After removal
of excessive heat using a water filter or dichroic mirror they can be
used with narrow band-pass filters for the determination of effects at
different wavelengths such as action spectra. Care must be taken not to
focus the source onto the mirror or filter which can be readily damaged
by excessive heat.

:::

In addition to the essential safety considerations when using any UV
sources (detailed in section [8.1](#sec:safety){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:safety"}), important additional safety precautions are
necessary when using xenon arc lamps. The high pressure inside the lamps
creates a risk of explosion during installation and during operation,
which increases with lamp age. An impact resistant face shield and heavy
protective gloves should be worn when handling a lamp and it must never
be touched with the fingers as grease marks increase the risk of
failure. Lamps are supplied in a protective cover which should remain in
place until installation and they should only be used inside a
specialised housing that provides explosion protection to contain flying
glass should an explosion occur. A specialised lamp housing is normally
provided with a fan for cooling the lamp which gets extremely hot and
ventilation should continue for at least five minutes after the lamp is
switched off. This is usually achieved in a specialised housing with
temperature sensors or timers. However, some lamps (sometimes called
'UV-enhanced') produce short UV wavelengths ($<$`<!-- -->`{=html}250 nm)
that generate large quantities of ozone which is toxic and can cause
respiratory problems and asthma attacks. The ozone must be removed from
the room and building by additional ventilation systems or absorbed and
destroyed by special filters. Alternatively, 'ozone-free' lamps are most
often used and have a quartz envelope that absorbs below 250 nm and so
prevents excessive ozone formation. A xenon arc lamp is extremely bright
and the intense visible radiation can damage the eyes in addition to UV
effects. The arc or its intense image must never be viewed directly as
it can cause permanent eye damage. When using the equipment, the
illuminated areas may also be extremely bright and dark coloured goggles
should be worn, such as those used in welding that also provide UV
protection, ensuring that the eyes are also protected from side
illumination as well as directly. It is essential to follow the
manufacturers' instructions with respect to lamp life and operating
current in order to maximise their useful life and minimise the risk of
failure due to explosion. Further information on xenon arc sources and
other high intensity lamp sources sometimes used in photobiology is
provided by @Holmes1984a.

### Deuterium lamps {#sec:lamps:deuterium}

High intensity water-cooled deuterium lamps (150 W) have a fairly flat
radiant intensity curve in the UV-B region (approximately 1.5--3.0
between 280 and 300 nm at a distance of 30 cm) that is appropriate for
mechanistic plant UV photobiology studies. This type of radiation
sources (e.g. produced by Hamamatsu Photonics) requires a dedicated
control box for operation but is still an affordable alternative to
lasers, starting at about 2,500€ for a setup. High intensity deuterium
lamps have been used for wavelength dependence measurements both in
photobiology [@Kalbin2005; @Kalbina2008] and photochemistry
[@Kalbin2005] when fitted with the appropriate filters. The lamp has to
be mounted horizontally to allow efficient water cooling but using
spreading lenses and a mirror mounted in a 45$^\circ$ angle to the
incident radiation a full rosette can easily be irradiated
[@Kalbina2008] and, the UV irradiation can be supplemented with PAR from
external sources as desired. A drawback of this type of equipment is the
short life of the radiation source (a few hundred hours). Spare lamps
cost approximately 1 500 €.

### LEDs {#sec:LEDs}

The principle of a light emitting diode (LED) is totally different to
conventional incandescent light bulbs. It is a semiconductor consisting
of two types of layer: one layer releasing electrons as a direct current
to fill holes in another. Energy is released as a photon at a wavelength
(colour) that depends on the band gap energy of the materials comprising
each of the two layers (Figure
[\[fig:LED:junction\]](#fig:LED:junction){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:LED:junction"}).

::: figure*
![image](figures/PnJunction-LED-E.pdf){width="0.8\\myfigwidth"}
:::

Due to this emission of photons at a very precise wavelength, the
typical spectrum of a LED shows one distinct peak. The emitted
wavelength range can be increased by adding a fluorescing material to
the LED. This is shown in Figure
[\[fig:LED\]](#fig:LED){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:LED"}
together with a measurement of the solar irradiance at the Helmholtz
Zentrum München in Neuherberg, Germany. The maximum spectral irradiance
of the LED peak (measurement at 20 cm distance) is more than one order
of magnitude lower than that of the solar irradiance (which is the
reason a semilogarithmic scale is used). All measurements were made
using a double-monochromator spectroradiometer (Bentham, Reading, UK).

::: figure*
![image](figures/fig_leds.pdf){width="0.8\\myfigwidth"}
:::

::: figure*
![image](figures/fig_uvleds.pdf){width="0.8\\myfigwidth"}
:::

If the correct semiconductor material is chosen, almost any wavelength
can be produced even in the UV range. The intensity of LEDs (Figure
[\[fig:UVLED\]](#fig:UVLED){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:UVLED"})
is much lower than that of LEDs emitting visible light, even at a
shorter distance than in Figure
[\[fig:LED\]](#fig:LED){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:LED"}.
Normally, the optical power of a LED is around 1 W or less for visible
radiation and only around 0.5 mW for UV radiation. There are LEDs
available with higher power (many of them are arrays of tens of chips on
a single package) but they require an additional cooling device. These
arrays can emit up to 50 mW of radiation, however, they are very
expensive. This is one of the most important reasons why LEDs alone are
not useful *at the moment* for exposing plants to radiation. In
addition, many different LEDs or specially designed LEDs are necessary
to approximate the wavelength distribution of the solar spectrum. On the
other hand, LEDs have been in common use for photosynthesis research for
a long time [@tennessen1994] and many gas-exchange instruments use LEDs
as a light source.

LEDs are low voltage direct current (DC) devices. The current through a
LED must be limited. The simplest current limiter is a resistor
connected in series with the LED. The calculator at
<http://ledcalculator.net/> can be used to determine the value of the
required resistor. There is also a handy pair of Android applications,
'elektor LED Resistor Calculator' and 'elektor Resistor Color Code',
available for free from Google Play (<https://play.google.com/>).

### Spectrographs {#sec:spectrographs}

A spectrograph composed of a light source and a
[monochromator]{acronym-label="monochromator"
acronym-form="singular+short"} may be used in applications requiring
spectrally-resolved UV radiation exposure of biological specimens. This
may be the case when searching for wavelength dependencies in plant
responses or investigating specific effects known *a priori* to depend
on wavelength.

The selection of a light source is application driven and depends on the
requirements imposed by the study. The main requirements concern the
intensity and the spectral distribution of the radiant output of the
lamp. The geometry of the setup, including the source-target-distance
and the area of exposure, sets certain limits not only on the light
source but also on the characteristics of the monochromator.

A schematic representation of a typical single monochromator is shown in
Figure [\[fig:spectrograph\]](#fig:spectrograph){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:spectrograph"}. The light emitted by the light source is
directed onto the entrance slit of the monochromator. The collimating
mirror reflects the light onto the grating that diffracts the light into
its spectral components. The diffracted light is reflected by the
focusing mirror onto the exit slit. Two single monochromators may be
aligned in a way that the exit slit of the first monochromator serves as
the entrance slit of the second monochromator. This arrangement makes up
a double monochromator which provides better
[stray:light]{acronym-label="stray:light" acronym-form="singular+short"}
rejection than single monochromators. Commercially available
monochromators of both types exist.

::: figure*
![image](figures/fig_spectrograph.pdf){width="0.8\\myfigwidth"}
:::

In the setup of a single monochromator shown in Figure
[\[fig:spectrograph\]](#fig:spectrograph){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:spectrograph"}, photons of only one wavelength would
ideally exit the exit slit. However, as the slits have finite
dimensions, the actual output would be a narrow line of radiation,
peaking around a certain nominal central wavelength. Two approaches are
commonly adopted to achieve the production of multiple
spatially-separated lines. The grating may be equipped with a drive arm
rotating the grating. Ideally, for each position of the grating, only
radiation of a certain wavelength is reflected and focused onto the exit
slit one at a time. Alternatively, the focusing mirror may be omitted
and replaced by a sample exposure plane. Ideally, in each position on
the plane, only radiation of a certain wavelength would be present
(Figure [\[fig:UVEMA\]](#fig:UVEMA){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:UVEMA"}).

::: figure*
![image](photos/UVEMA_spectrograph.pdf){width="0.8\\myfigwidth"}
:::

The main characteristics of a monochromator that should be considered
include wavelength region, wavelength accuracy, bandwidth of the lines,
and the amount of stray light. These characteristics set guidelines for
design of the layout of the optical components, selection of the slit
widths, and formulation of the specifications for the grating. An
unavoidable compromise must be made between the wavelength resolution
and the intensity. Finer separation of the wavelengths comes with lower
intensities and vice versa. Stray light rejection may be improved by
placing suitably-designed baffles inside the enclosure of the
spectrograph. For applications requiring superior stray light rejection,
a double monochromator should be used.

The main characteristics of the grating include groove spacing and a
ruled area. For a spectrograph operating at UV radiation wavelengths, a
holographic grating is a more feasible choice than a ruled grating
because it can achieve a higher resolution. The main difference between
ruled and holographic gratings is the process of their manufacture. A
ruled grating has grooves scribed by a diamond on a ruling machine,
whereas holographic gratings are produced by a photolithographic process
using lasers which are able to achieve a higher groove density. Should
the focal plane be flat, a concave grating must be used. The size of the
grating has certain practical limits set by the manufacturers. The
maximum size of the exposure area is essentially limited by the size of
the grating.

Selection of the light source is defined by the desired wavelengths, the
intensity levels, and the spectral distribution of the radiation. For
experiments imitating natural exposure, light sources exhibiting
radiative characteristics resembling those of natural sunlight, such as
xenon-arc lamps, should be used. The heat tolerances of the substrates
of the gratings are limited. As a consequence, the light entering the
monochromator may have to be filtered to remove excessive infra-red
radiation which is often achieved using a water filter. (see
subsubsection [8.2.1.2](#sec:xenon){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:xenon"} on page )

In addition to the small spectrographs described above, there are also
much larger instruments. Many of these dispense with the exit slit, and
project the dispersed spectrum onto a 'stage'. @Watanabe1982 describe a
large spectrograph designed for irradiating biological samples. Over a
curved 10 m-long focal plane covering wavelengths of 250 to 1000 nm,
many samples can be irradiated simultaneously. There are few such
spectrographs in the world, but they are important for measuring action
and response spectra [e.g. @Saitou1993].

### Lasers {#sec:lasers}

*Laser* stands for 'Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of
Radiation'. Stimulated emission can be induced in many different
materials, and when light is confined in a cavity between mirrors the
stimulated emission is amplified yielding a narrow beam of spatially-
and temporarily coherent, and [collimated]{acronym-label="collimated"
acronym-form="singular+short"} light. Lasers usually produce very narrow
and intense beams of monochromatic light, although there are exceptions.
Some lasers are tunable, meaning that the wavelength of the emitted
light beam can be varied. One of the many ways of achieving this is to
replace the mirror at one end of the cavity with a movable prism or
grating. The lasing medium can be a solid crystal, a gas or a dye in
solution. Lasers are said to be 'pumped' by a source of light, for
example a lamp external to the lasing cavity.

Laser diodes are semiconductor lasers. They are solid state devices
producing a laser beam based on the same principle as other lasers. They
are pumped by the light emitted when electrons and 'holes' interact in
the semiconductor junction. They are used to excite other types of
lasers, in printers and CD/DVD/BD players. Blu-ray disc players use
laser diodes which emit blue-violet light. There are emitting laser
diodes of low power, for example, emitting 20 mW at 375 nm. The
semiconductor material used in this case is . In addition the catalogue
of Roithner Lasertechnik GmbH (Vienna, Austria) lists 'diode pumped
solid state lasers' emitting at 266 nm and at 355 nm. Non solid-state
lasers that emit in the region are also available. For example argon ion
lasers continuously emit at wavelengths of 334 and 351 nm.

The power of lasers varies from 1--5 mW for laser pointers to 100 kW for
lasers under development for military use. The coherent and concentrated
beam can cause serious damage to eyesight, and safety precautions should
be taken during their use, unless they are of very low power (see
section [8.1](#sec:safety){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:safety"}
on page ).

Lasers can be used for example in characterizing the slit function of
spectrometers (see section
[9.7.2.2](#sec:array:calibration){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:array:calibration"} on page ), for aligning optics, and
in the ubiquitous barcode readers used in supermarkets and laser
pointers used by speakers during lectures. They are used in instruments
like confocal microscopes and different analytical procedures in
chemistry and biology. They can also be used to excite photochemical or
photobiological systems if the target is small.

For the purpose of UV photobiology, tunable optical parametric
oscillator (OPO) pump lasers (pump wavelength 355 nm) are especially
useful in mechanistic studies such as in accurate wavelength dependence
determinations or action spectroscopy (O'Hara, Strid and Jenkins, in
preparation). Placing a cuvette holder in the beam, a plant extract or a
protein solution can be accurately irradiated using 50 or 100 cuvettes.
By using the appropriate optics (lenses, mirrors, etc.; Figure
[\[fig:tunable:laser\]](#fig:tunable:laser){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:tunable:laser"}), the geometry of the beam can be
manipulated so that a larger area or sample (several cm$^2$) can be
illuminated. This is large enough for exposing for instance part of an
rosette, or for simultaneously irradiating two detached leaves. Tuneable
lasers can also be used for studies of complex mechanistic interactions
between several plant photoreceptors, since they can be used within a
short time interval (seconds) at different wavelengths, e.g. for
irradiation first in the , then in the blue or red.

When using lasers for photobiological purposes, a number of
circumstances need to be taken into account. Lasers emit their radiation
in the form of pulses and this should be kept in mind when designing the
experiments. Usually, both the energy of the pulses and the pulse rate
can be varied within limits, depending on the sophistication (and
price!) of the equipment. Pulse rates between 1 to 20 Hz in the more
affordable machines up to 1000 Hz in the more expensive ones can be
obtained. The pulses are typically 5--10 ns in length and the linewidth
is usually around 0.5 nm (Figure
[\[fig:laser:output\]](#fig:laser:output){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:laser:output"}), making this type of instrumentation
ideal for studies of the initial UV signalling events on the biochemical
and cell biological levels. Also, due to the physical principles on
which a tunable laser in the UV region relies, some residual radiation
with double the desired wavelength may still be present in the beam
exiting the apparatus. This has to be taken care of by using a filter in
the light-path blocking the longer wavelengths. For instance, when
irradiating a plant with a wavelength of 300 nm, care must be taken so
that any 600 nm component will be blocked out to be sure that the
biological effect is due to the UV-B alone and not the red light. Of
course, the laser UV-B radiation can be supplemented with PAR from other
light sources as required.

:::

Laser radiation is measured as the energy emitted (in J) in each pulse
or in a train of pulses using a pulse energy meter. This then has to be
related to the area actually irradiated. The maximal output energy for a
flash at 280 nm typically ranges between 40 and 200 . The spectral
bandwidth and the accuracy of the wavelength setting should be checked
prior to use with a calibrated diode array spectroradiometer (Figure
[\[fig:laser:output\]](#fig:laser:output){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:laser:output"}). As might be expected, the major drawback
of using lasers, in addition to the small area that usually can be
irradiated, is the cost. Lasers useful for UV-B photobiological purposes
at present start at approximately 50 000 €.

### Modulated UV-B supplementation systems {#sec:modulated}

There are two types of supplementation systems for use outdoors:
square-wave and modulated. Square-wave supplementation systems work by
simply switching the lamps on and off. The only control on the dose of
is the length of time that the lamps are energized each day. Modulated
systems work by continuously adjusting lamp -radiation output, which is
usually called dimming. Furthermore, in modulated systems, the dimming
of the lamps is adjusted by means of a feedback control system.
radiation is measured both with supplement and without and the control
system is programmed so that the treatment is a fixed percent increase
in above the control condition, or in some cases, above true ambient
conditions. @McLeod1997 reviews many of the early modulated and
square-wave systems, and discusses many of the compromises and
limitations involved in their use and design. Figure
[\[fig:botania\]](#fig:botania){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:botania"} shows one lamp frame from a modulated system,
and Figure [\[fig:botania:new\]](#fig:botania:new){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:botania:new"} shows an overhead view.

:::

A modulated system automatically adjusts the supplement following
changes in natural irradiance with time of day and also compensates for
ageing of cellulose diacetate filters, and changes in lamp output with
ambient temperature.

@Caldwell1983 describe a modulated system based on custom built
electronics, which works even at very low ambient temperatures.
@Aphalo1999a describe a system built from off-the-shelf components and
controlled by a datalogger, which does not work at temperatures below 0.
Figure [\[fig:UV:modulated\]](#fig:UV:modulated){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:UV:modulated"} shows, for this system, the daily course
of irradiance under near-ambient control and enhancement frames
throughout two days with different cloud conditions. Occasionally,
modulated systems have also been used inside greenhouses [e.g.
@Hunt1998a]. Another approach is to use a [PID]{acronym-label="PID"
acronym-form="singular+short"} algorithm in an industrial
micro-controller module to control the dimming of the lamps. Such a
modulated systems has been built based on Gantner intelligent modules
(Gantner Instruments Test & Measurement GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany, Matti
Savinainen, pers. comm.). It is also possible to use a personal computer
and a PID control algorithm implemented in a graphical instrument
control and measurement language like LabVIEW (National Instruments
Corporation, Austin, TX, USA) or FlowStone (DPS Robotics, UK).

::: figure*
![image](figures/fig_modulated.pdf){width="0.8\\myfigwidth"}
:::

Modulated systems, like any other supplementation system, require
frequent checks and replacement of burnt lamps and aged filters. It is
recommended to replace acetate filters regularly. For lamps (except for
the odd 'early deaths') it is recommended that they are replaced
following a fixed schedule as lamp output degrades with lamp age. This
is especially important in those systems not having separate feedback
control for each lamp frame, as having lamps of different ages in
monitored and slave frames would lead to inaccuracies in the level of
supplementation between frames.

Modulated systems are preferable to square-wave systems as they avoid
excessive supplementation during periods of low and low natural
irradiance. They also compensate for fluctuations in lamp output.
However, they are more difficult to design and build, and consequently
more expensive. The drawbacks of square-wave systems can be moderated by
completely switching off the system on rainy and cloudy days, or by
automatically switching off supplementation when irradiance goes below a
certain threshold. The duration of square-wave exposure may also be
limited to fixed hours either side of solar noon. @Musil2002 evaluated
the errors involved in the use of square-wave systems and concluded that
they are not very large, whereas @Diaz2006 concluded that modulated
systems are preferable. However, it is difficult to assess the effect of
the unrealistic treatments in square-wave systems on the outcome of
experiments as comparisons have been solely based on differences in
irradiation regimes rather than on the responses of plants.

Enhancement errors in the calculation of effective irradiance are
discussed in section
[9.10.3](#sec:enhancement:errors){reference-type="ref"

### Exposure chambers and sun simulators {#sec:simulators}

Two main types of sun simulators exist: small systems based, for
example, on xenon-arc lamps (see
[8.2.1.2](#sec:xenon){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:xenon"} on
page ), and large systems built by combining several types of lamps and
filters to achieve a simulation of the solar spectrum; so called "sun
simulators" and "(walk-in-size) exposure chambers". The latter are
sometimes called a 'phytotron' [@Bickford1972]. The principal concept of
how to design plant growth chambers can be found for example in
@Langhans1997.

Here, a description is given in more detail of the phytotron built at
the Research Unit Environmental Simulation of the Helmholtz Zentrum
München, Neuherberg, Germany[^17]. This phytotron facility consists of a
set of seven closed chambers (length $\cdot$ width $\cdot$ height):

-   four walk-in-size chambers (3.4 m $\times$ 2.8 m $\times$ 2.5 m),

-   two medium-size sun simulators (1.4 m $\times$ 1.4 m $\times$
    1.0 m),

-   one small sun simulator (1.2 m $\times$ 1.2 m $\times$ 0.4 m).

In order to extrapolate response of plants from experiments to those in
their natural habitat, these experiments need to be performed under
realistic and reproducible conditions. The radiation provided must be as
realistic as possible. Not only the quantity but also the spectral
quality of radiation has to match the seasonal and diurnal variations
occurring in nature [@caldw94]. This includes the steep absorption
characteristics of radiation that result from the filtering of solar
irradiance by stratospheric ozone as well as the balance between the , ,
and . As no single artificial light source can simulate both spectral
quality and spectral quantity of global irradiance, a combination of
metal halide lamps (400 W HQI Daylight, Osram, Germany), quartz halogen
lamps (500 W Halostar, Osram, Germany), and blue fluorescent tubes (40 W
TLD 18, Philips, the Netherlands) are used in order to simulate the
spectrum from the to the near IR wavelengths. Excess infra-red radiation
is removed by a layer of water. Underneath this water filter, additional
quartz halogen lamps (300 W Halostar, Osram, Germany) are installed to
adjust the mid and far IR radiation. The missing irradiance is
supplemented by fluorescent tubes (40 W TL 12, Philips, the
Netherlands). The radiation output of these fluorescent tubes, however,
extends to well below 280 nm. This portion must be blocked very
efficiently. Selected borosilicate and lime glass filters as well as
acrylic 'glass' filters and plastic sheets provide a sufficiently steep
cut-off at the desired wavelength. Different combinations of these
glasses and films allow the cut-off wavelength to be altered, thus
enabling a simulation various scenarios as shown for example in figure
[\[fig:Poly:Spectra\]](#fig:Poly:Spectra){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Poly:Spectra"} in section
[7.8](#sec:action:spectra){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:action:spectra"} on page . The diurnal variations of the
irradiance are achieved by switching appropriate groups of lamps on and
off. The optimised lamp configuration of the ceiling is presented in
Figure [\[fig:SoSi:Lamps\]](#fig:SoSi:Lamps){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:SoSi:Lamps"}. A more detailed description is given by
@Seckmeyer1993, @doehr96 and @Thiel1996. Figure

The lamps are mounted far above the cultivation area in order to obtain
a homogeneous spatial distribution of the radiation. Deviations from
homogeneity, indicated by the ratio of spectral irradiance at any
position to that at the central position, do not exceed 20% for all
wavelengths but, due to non-symmetric lamp mounting, can depend on
wavelength. The horizontal distribution of in the cultivation area is
shown in figure

station of the Helmholtz Zentrum München, Neuherberg, Germany.
Measurements in the sun simulator show that the steep, realistic shape
of the edge and the ratio can be simulated very close to nature. The
ratio of the sun simulator is $1:23:194$ and matches the natural
conditions of $1:25:206$ very well.

Besides the lighting, temperature, and humidity, the atmosphere in the
chamber is also controlled. Typical gaseous pollutants such as ozone,
nitric oxides, and combustion residuals can be introduced. The effects
of carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons on plants can also be studied. Modern
control technology with central monitoring ensures a safe and
well-defined operation.

## Filters {#sec:filters}

In UV research, optical filters are used in different contexts, in
measuring instruments and in UV radiation sources. In the case of
instruments, they are used in most broadband sensors to achieve the
desired spectral response. They are also used in some spectrometers to
improve stray light performance and remove second order artifacts.

They are used in lamp sources like laboratory solar simulators based on
xenon arc lamps. In experiments with UV-B fluorescent lamps they are
used to absorb short wavelength radiation in the UV-B treatment and to
achieve comparable no UV-B controls. These uses are discussed in section
[8.2.1](#sec:lamps){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:lamps"} on page
. In the current section, in addition to introducing the optical
properties of filters, we will mainly discuss the use of filters to
manipulate the spectrum of sunlight in field experiments.

### Optical properties of filters {#sec:filters:properties}

There are different types of filters. Band-pass filters transmit
radiation in a given range of wavelengths or band, and absorb or reflect
light outside this range. The band can be either wide or narrow. Cut-off
filters can be either long-pass, or short-pass: respectively
transmitting all radiation of longer wavelengths than a cutoff
wavelength and transmitting all radiation of wavelengths shorter than a
cutoff (less common). The transition is a slope that can be steep or
gradual depending on the filter.

Just like any object, filters reflect, absorb or transmit radiation.
These are the only three possible fates of incident radiation.
[reflectance]{acronym-label="reflectance" acronym-form="singular+short"}
(), [absorptance]{acronym-label="absorptance"
acronym-form="singular+short"} () and
[transmittance]{acronym-label="transmittance"
acronym-form="singular+short"} () are the corresponding fractions of the
incident radiation such that $\refl + \abst + \trans = 1$ (or if
expressed as percentages they add up to 100%). Absorptance should not
the confused with [absorbance]{acronym-label="absorbance"
acronym-form="singular+short"} () which is a different quantity given by
$\absb = \log \frac{1}{\trans}$. All these quantities can be defined
either for a broad band, or for very narrow band (e.g. where $\lambda$
is the wavelength). In the latter case, we can measure across
wavelengths obtaining a spectrum.

When describing filters, the main property of interest is spectral
transmittance. Most filters work by absorbing radiation of the unwanted
wavelengths. However, some special filters work by reflecting the
unwanted radiation. This is important when working with high power light
sources: reflecting filters warm up much less that absorbing filters. An
example of reflecting filters are the so called heat mirrors, which
reflect infra-red radiation.

For light absorbing filters, like many of those made from plastic or
optical glass, the optical characteristics depend not only on the
material but also on its thickness. For this reason it is important to
always indicate both type and thickness when describing a filter. In
many cases one can take advantage of this phenomenon when planning
experiments as the cutoff wavelength depends on the thickness of the
filter.

Another important property of filters is whether they scatter radiation
or not. When light is scattered the diffuse radiation component
increases. For example, normal glass does not scatter visible radiation
while opaline (white glass) does. As the proportion of diffuse radiation
in PAR affects canopy photosynthesis
[@Okerblom1992; @Urban2007; @Markvart2010; @Urban2012] one should use
filters with similar scattering properties for all treatments.

Filters can be made from optical glass, gelatine, and many different
synthetic organic compounds. In many cases, coloured substances are used
as additives to the whole thickness of the material but sometimes a
layer is merely applied to the surface or between two layers of
transparent material. Glass filters tend to be very stable, but many
plastics and the additives they contain react when illuminated, and
deteriorate gradually when exposed to visible- and especially UV
radiation. Filters made from optical glass are a more expensive than
those made from plastics and tend to be readily available only in small
sizes. Plastic films used as filters tend to be available in large
sheets or rolls. Sometimes, liquid filters, usually aqueous solutions of
chemicals, can also be useful [see Chapter 11 in @Montalti2006 for
spectral transmittance for several liquid filters]. @Sampath-Wiley2011
describe a new type of liquid filter which makes it possible to obtain a
realistic simulation of the solar spectrum under laboratory conditions
using normal fluorescent lamps.

The engineering quality of atmospheric UV absorption by glass filter
techniques is sufficient for most plant experiments. However, this
method has its limitations. Strong UV exposure causes rapid ageing of
borosilicate glass filters due to a physico-chemical effect known as
solarisation. This originates in UV-induced changes in the oxidation
state of iron contaminants present in the glass matrix. The oxidation of
Fe$^{2+}$ to Fe$^{3+}$ is accompanied by an absorption shift to longer
wavelengths within the UV range. A decrease in the transmittance of
fresh glass filters occurs within their first few hours of use, followed
by a more-gradual long-term decline. Hence, changes in transmission
during an experiment can be largely avoided by the pre-ageing of new
filters. In addition, there is a gradient of ageing with the depth of
the glass. Soda-lime glass exhibits very much reduced ageing compared to
borosilicate glass. The solarisation of the soda-lime glass ceases after
a few hours of UV treatment and this may be due to its lower content of
iron contaminants [@doehr96].

### Manipulating UV radiation in sunlight {#sec:filters:manipulating:sunlight}

When using plastic films in the field they need to be supported in a way
such that they remain in place even under windy conditions and also so
that rainwater does not accumulate on top of them. It is important to be
aware that plastic filters modify the microclimate in several ways. If
they absorb infra-red radiation, even if transparent at other
wavelengths, they will alter the energy balance of plants and soil under
them. This produces a greenhouse effect that increases temperatures. If
they absorb they will affect photosynthesis, and even small differences
in transmittance () between treatments could be important. Plants are
partially protected from wind and completely shielded from rain by the
filters. In some cases even plasticizer additives (different phthalates)
added during plastic manufacture have been implicated in artifacts
caused by the use of cellulose diacetate film in exclusion experiments,
particularly when ventilation is restricted [@Krizek2004a].

As filters have so many side effects, it is not surprising that a
comparison against a no-filter control usually yields large differences,
demonstrating that comparisons examining the effects of UV attenuation
should always be done against controls under UV transparent films. Of
course, we may want to know how similar the conditions under control
filters are to natural conditions. In this case at least two types of
controls are needed: a control with a UV transparent filter and a
control without any filter. Figures

reference="fig:filters:photo:branch"} show some typical setups for
potted plants and branches respectively. Filters on tree branches have
been used by @Rousseaux2004, @Kotilainen2008 and others. Filters have
also been used to cover patches of natural vegetation by @Phoenix2003,
@Robson2004 and others. Filters have been used in experiments with
potted seedlings or plants by @Hunt1997, @Kotilainen2009, @Morales2010,
and others.

The spectral transmittance of several commonly used films is shown in
Figure
[\[fig:filter:T:spectra\]](#fig:filter:T:spectra){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:filter:T:spectra"}, and the resulting filtered sunlight
spectral irradiance in Figure
[\[fig:filter:sunlight:spectra\]](#fig:filter:sunlight:spectra){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:filter:sunlight:spectra"}. For near-ambient-UV controls
cellulose diacetate, polythene or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) are
normally used. Cellulose diacetate is not a good option as its optical
properties deteriorate fast, and after deterioration it absorbs more
UV-B radiation (Figure
[\[fig:filter:T:spectra:aging\]](#fig:filter:T:spectra:aging){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:filter:T:spectra:aging"}), tears easily, and is affected
by water. Cellulose diacetate is used for removing from the radiation
emitted by lamps (see section
[8.2.1.1](#sec:fluorescent:tubes){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:fluorescent:tubes"} on page ). In contrast as there is no
in solar radiation at ground level, other materials that are more
durable can be used for near-ambient controls in attenuation
experiments. Polythene film (types without UV absorbing additives only)
is very stable, and cheap, but usually scatters light slightly more than
the films used for UV-B attenuation. PTFE and related polymers (brand
names Teflon, Hostaflon, etc.) are extremely stable, transmit UV
radiation very well, and some types produce little scattering[^18]. Also
films made from polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE) (sold under the
trade name ACLAR) can be used. For UV-B attenuation experiments,
polyester film (e.g. brand names Mylar, Melinex, Autostat) is the filter
material most frequently used for attenuating with only a small effect
on irradiance. Sometimes soda glass (normal window glass) or special
acrylic plates are used instead of polyester. Polyester film produces
little scattering and glass and acrylic panes almost none. For
attenuation of the whole UV band, UV-absorbing theatrical gels can be
used. They are called gels for historical reasons but nowadays either
polyester or polycarbonate is used as base material. The most useful
type is the one with code #226, available with similar specifications
from several manufacturers (Rosco, Lee filters, Formatt filters, see the
Appendix on page for addresses). Rosco #0 is an UV-A and UV-B
transparent theatrical gel with spectral transmittance rather similar to
thin cellulose diacetate. Some polyester films can also remove all UV
wavelengths (e.g. brand name 'Courtgard'). Some experimental greenhouse
cladding films have cut-off wavelengths in the middle of the UV-A band
and provide additional possibilities. Theatrical gels are available only
in one standard thickness, but cellulose diacetate, polyester, PTFE and
polythene films are available in several different thicknesses.
Thickness affects both mechanical and optical properties (Figure
[\[fig:filter:T:spectra:thickness\]](#fig:filter:T:spectra:thickness){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:filter:T:spectra:thickness"}). The most common
thicknesses used for cellulose diacetate and polyester are 100 to 125 .
For polythene, thinner films can be used to minimize scattering if
mechanical strength is not limiting (e.g. 50 ). As PTFE is a strong
material, thin films can also be used, but one should be careful to
match PAR transmittance between all treatments.

Filters can be mounted on wooden, metal or wire frames, or sometimes,
especially when covering branches, on chicken wire net. It is important
to carefully chose the fastening method. On wooden frames staples or
thumb pins can be used, but the films tend to tear where they have been
perforated so reinforcing the edges with transparent or duct tape may be
necessary. It is important to use tapes that produce no toxic fumes, and
to use the same amount and type of tape for all treatments (e.g. not use
more tape for the films that break more easily). In harsh environments,
the propensity for filters to tear or fracture can be greatly reduced by
stretching them taut over the filtered plots to keep them still. This
can be achieved by unrolling filters firmly attached to two cylindrical
rods/poles clamped under tension to a structure anchored in the ground
(Figure
[\[fig:filters:photo:field1\]](#fig:filters:photo:field1){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:filters:photo:field1"} on page ), . This approach also
has the benefit over wooden frames of enabling a large number of filters
to be carried to the field at once undamaged, so can be of use to
researchers working at inaccessible field sites. When mounting the
filters good ventilation should be maintained, to avoid warming up of
the plants and soil under them. Careful consideration is needed when
making the compromise between the UV reduction achieved by adding
plastic curtains to increase the filtration of
[diffuse:rad]{acronym-label="diffuse:rad" acronym-form="singular+short"}
(or [direct:rad]{acronym-label="direct:rad"
acronym-form="singular+short"} when the solar elevation angle is small
at high latitudes), and the exacerbation of warming and further
reduction in ventilation that this will cause. In long-term filtration
experiments, the growth of dense vegetation under and around the filters
is a common problem which can lead to large unwanted changes in the
microclimate in experimental plots.

The impracticality of filtering entire trees means that branch filters
are often the most acceptable substitutes when assessing the effects of
solar UV radiation on trees. However their installation and maintenance
involves several additional considerations beyond those attached to
fixed frames. Branch filters should be located only on the top and sides
of branches, while the underside should be left open for ventilation and
access. A structure of chicken wire and aluminium cables can maintain
the shape of the filter while minimising contact between the filter and
the treated part of the branch, however the weight of the structure
should be kept to a minimum to reduce shading and the risk of mechanical
damage to the tree. Filters mounted on branches behave like flags in the
wind, so branches on which filters are installed need to be tethered to
the ground or their movement stabilised using wooden canes attached to a
different large branch or limb of the tree, or preferably a combination
of both these restraints, so that they do not move un-naturally or break
in windy weather. By necessity in such experiments, the filtered area is
relatively small and requires frequent maintenance to keep the shoots
and leaves from growing into the filter or growing too far away from the
filter into areas where they receive too much unfiltered and diffuse UV
radiation. Particular attention should be given to the orientation of
branch filters on a tree. For instance, branches and filters orientated
to the north receive a very different dose of visible and UV radiation
from those orientated to the south [@Rousseaux2004]. Comparing similar
branches of the same tree under different filtration treatments is an
obvious way to reduce the random variability among experimental units,
but it is important to be aware that signals could potentially pass
between different filtered branches and unfiltered branches which may
dilute the response of a particular branch to its UV treatment. One
method of controlling for communication between branches involves
excising the phloem of filtered branches. However, this isolation brings
other problems as the realism of the experiment is reduced, so the need
to adopt this approach will depend on the aims of each individual
experiment. Maintaining branch filters in situ during the autumn and
winter is not always practically feasible, however when using species
that have determinate growth, their environment, particularly the
radiation they receive, during bud set and the formation of leaf
primordia can influence subsequent growth and leaf traits during the
following growing season.

Sometimes the design of an experiment requires intermediate levels of
attenuation, and this can be achieved by mounting strips of one type of
plastic film on a base of another type (Figure
[\[fig:filters:photo:one:frame\]](#fig:filters:photo:one:frame){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:filters:photo:one:frame"}). In such a system the strips
are usually fastened at the edges of the wooden or wire frame on which
the whole filter is attached. Unless the frames are small (less than 30
to 50 cm long sides) it may also be necessary to attach the strips in
the middle with tape. In such a case the tape used must be clear to both
PAR and UV radiation. The cheapest old-fashioned stationery tapes use a
cellulose acetate substrate and are good for this purpose (e.g. Scotch
Crystal Clear). Strips are usually 10 to 15 mm wide and if the desired
effect is 50% attenuation, they are attached with a separation equal to
their own width. Cutting the strips with scissors is a big task, but
printers' shops can usually cut them efficiently for a small charge. The
UV irradiance under filters with strips is heterogeneous but the patches
move with solar transit through the sky. This is more of a problem for
measurement of irradiances than for the application of the treatments as
reciprocity between irradiation time and irradiance apparently holds for
such experiments [@Rosa2001].

Even if we use filters that are totally opaque to UV-B, the treatment
will not lead to total UV-B exclusion. That is why we use the phrase
'UV-B attenuation' for such treatments (Figure
[\[fig:filter:maps\]](#fig:filter:maps){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:filter:maps"}). As discussed in section
[7.4](#sec:solar:radiation){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:solar:radiation"} on page , solar UV radiation includes a
large proportion of diffuse radiation coming from the sky, even under
non-cloudy conditions. Consequently, some UV radiation penetrates under
the edges of filters. It is therefore necessary to avoid locating
experimental plants near the edges of the filters, and we recommend to
have at least one row of border plants, forming a so-called 'guard row',
from which no data are collected. Furthermore, it is possible to use
curtains of the same filter material on the sides of the frames, but one
should not close all sides as air movement is needed to avoid elevated
temperatures and unnaturally still air. The filters should not be too
high above the plants and irradiance should be measured at all the
different positions where measured plants are located, rather than just
under the centre of the frame.

### Measuring the spectral transmittance of filters

The recommended instrument for measuring filter spectral transmittance
is a spectrometer or spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating
sphere. Using an integrating sphere ensures that all transmitted
radiation, both non-scattered and scattered is taken into account in the
measurement. For non-scattering filters, one can obtain a reasonable
approximation of the total spectral transmittance with a regular
spectrophotometer. In most cases it is adequate to cut a piece of the
film to the size of a cuvette and insert it carefully in the cuvette
holder. In some models with an open light path (e.g. HP 8453, Hewlett
Packard Gmbh, Waldbronn, Germany, now Agilent) it is possible to put a
larger piece of filter material in the light path outside the cuvette
holder but close to it. For measuring in the UV-B band one needs an
instrument using a deuterium lamp as radiation source. The spectral
resolution is important, and ideally should be 1 or 2 nm.

The optical properties of all filters change with time, even if the
material from which they are made is stable, because filters get
scratched and dirty. Dust and pollen stick to the filter surfaces and
particles attach more tenaciously to some materials than others so that
the filters in some treatments may become dirtier than in others. In
addition to cleaning and replacing the filters regularly, it is
necessary to measure the spectral transmittance of both new and used
filters. We also recommend that samples of the filters are taken both at
the start and end of their use and are stored protected from light and
heat at least until the results of the experiments have been published,
but preferably for longer.

## Manipulating UV-B in the aquatic environment {#sec:manipulating:aquatic}

### Incubations in the field

In contrast to the situation in terrestrial environments, field
experimentation with aquatic organisms is constrained not only by the
underwater light conditions but also by a suite of physical
perturbations (e.g. wave action, tidal fluctuations, currents,
sedimentation, etc.). In the case of benthic macrophytes, an important
factor that has to be considered is their vertical distribution. Deep or
constantly submerged environments impose different difficulties compared
to e.g. intertidal locations, which are subjected to changing light
conditions due to the action of tides. In lakes and rivers, differences
in the concentration of suspended absorbing substances between the
surface and deeper habitats can be important. An experimental design for
the study of seaweeds normally includes different filters cutting-off
and (see section [8.3](#sec:filters){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:filters"} for details).

Algae can be exposed to these different radiation conditions by using
self-made incubators constructed with plastic frames and nets with
different diameters and forms depending of the size of the macrophyte
(Figure
[\[fig:marine:incubation\]](#fig:marine:incubation){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:marine:incubation"}). Both the cylindrical and sheet
Plexiglass incubators can be covered by appropriate UV cut-off films and
located at different water depths by using ropes or buoys. E.g. as used
by @Gomez2005 with the red alga in the Quempillen Estuary (Chile). The
cylindrical incubators can be also used in intertidal pools, allowing
them to float or locating them at the bottom of a pool. In general,
experiments dealing with effects of natural radiation on aquatic
organisms are carried out in a range of depths between 0 and 10 m to
represent the penetration depth in coastal waters.

::: figure*
![image](photos/fig_marine_incubation2.pdf){width="0.8\\myfigwidth"}
:::

The diurnal variability of solar radiation is one of the most important
factors to consider when working with aquatic macrophytes in the field.
In general, at temperate and cold-temperate locations, daily changes in
the irradiance conditions are also exacerbated by depth, which affects
the number of hours during which algae are exposed to radiation. It is
well known that photosynthetic physiology changes during the day with
maximum rates of photoinhibition (a mechanism of dissipation of excess
energy) occurring during the highest solar irradiance at midday, while a
recovery in the photosynthetic capacity is found in the afternoon
[@Hader1996; @Figueroa1997; @Gomez2004]. This pattern is well
generalized in macrophytes and strongly dependent on the growth depth:
individuals growing at shallow depths show a more efficient
photoinhibition than their deeper counterparts [@Franklin1997]. Thus,
experimental designs employing transplantation or incubations at
different depths along the water column should consider these potential
confounding effects.

Tides are also a relevant factor affecting radiation in shallow marine
waters, especially for intertidal species. Fluctuations in the height of
the water column caused by tidal regimes can reduce or increase
considerably the available UV radiation. For example, in a study
comparing two coastal systems with different tidal range, @Huovinen2011
demonstrated that algae from fjords, with tidal ranges close to 7 m,
exhibited less difference in photosynthetic light demand and
susceptibility to radiation than algae from an open coast where maximal
tidal variation was 2 m. Probably, this is a major factor influencing
experimentation with benthic intertidal macrophytes, especially in
highly dynamic systems that may also be characterized by strong wave
action.

### Incubation under artificial lamps

The effect of radiation on aquatic plants can also be studied using
incubations under controlled illumination conditions (using lamps) in
the laboratory (Figure
[\[fig:lab:incubation\]](#fig:lab:incubation){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:lab:incubation"}). Normally the sources are similar to
those used for incubations of terrestrial plants (see section
[8.2.1](#sec:lamps){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:lamps"}).

::: figure*
![image](photos/fig_lab_aqua_incubation.pdf){width="0.8\\myfigwidth"}
:::

In general, experimentation on aquatic plants using small vessels under
laboratory conditions is designed to test for effects of in isolated
cells or small sized macrophytes. In the case of large seaweeds
(e.g. kelps), space limitation restricts incubations to pieces or sample
discs. In the case of seaweeds, due to their simple morphological
organization, the use of cut sections still allows a realistic
extrapolation of the situation in the whole thallus.

The optical characteristics and shape of the vessels containing the
samples strongly determine the orientation of the sample to the UV
source and the experimental setup. Often the vessels used in routine
incubations are opaque to radiation (e.g. Pyrex, and many types of glass
ware and polycarbonate), and thus lamps should be located above them.
However, there are various transparent materials, e.g. methacrylate
(Type GS-2458) or quartz glass, which permits irradiation from different
sides and mimics better the natural underwater conditions. In
experimental setups which cover vessels with cut-off filters, bubbles
from aeration can affect the penetration and diffraction patterns within
the vessels. Thus, cut-off and neutral filters should be kept at
sufficient distance from the water.

Due to the heat emission of lamps, temperature within the incubation
chamber can vary considerably, which should be taken into account,
similar as with incubations of terrestrial plants. This factor is
especially relevant for algae subject to small changes in temperature in
their habitat, e.g. some deep water and polar algae. Thermoregulated
water baths can minimize this problem
(Figure [\[fig:lab:incubation\]](#fig:lab:incubation){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:lab:incubation"}).

The use of artificial sources presents various advantages. Firstly, the
manipulation of the :ratio can permit the examination of some processes
that normally are masked by the prevailing high irradiances in the
field, as well as simulations of different scenarios. Secondly, it is
possible to standardize conditions for physiology, a situation not
normally possible in the natural habitat, where unpredictable
environment conditions (e.g. water motion, scattered light field) make
*in situ* experimentation difficult.

## Suitable treatments and controls

In every experiment one must include a suitable control in addition to
treatments. What is a suitable control will depend on the aims of the
study. In order to assess the effect of radiation, then the only
difference between an treatment and the control treatment should be the
irradiance of . This may seem obvious, but it is important to think
about the consequence of this for the design of experiments. Many
sources emit in addition to radiation, , -A and visible radiation.
Common sources emit in addition to , , and visible radiation. As most
fluorescent and some other UV sources emit small amounts of radiation,
which is absent in sunlight, radiation must be removed by filtration.
See Box [\[ex:lamps:controls\]](#ex:lamps:controls){reference-type="ref"
reference="ex:lamps:controls"} for descriptions of some typical
experimental designs and their advantages and pitfalls.

::: example*
[]{#ex:lamps:controls label="ex:lamps:controls"}

Case

:   We use Q-Panel UVB-313 tubes, or Philips TL12 fluorescent tubes
    outdoors. These lamps are sold as broadband lamps, but they emit
    radiation of other wavelengths (, , and visible) in addition to (see
    Figure
    [\[fig:TL12:UVB313:UVA340\]](#fig:TL12:UVB313:UVA340){reference-type="ref"
    reference="fig:TL12:UVB313:UVA340"} on page ). Our objective is to
    study the effect of radiation.

Design 1

:   We remove from the treatment by filtering the lamps with cellulose
    diacetate (see Figure
    [\[fig:filter:T:spectra\]](#fig:filter:T:spectra){reference-type="ref"
    reference="fig:filter:T:spectra"} on page ). We add (and a very
    small amount of visible radiation) to the controls by having
    identical lamps as in the treatments but filtered with polyester
    film, which absorbs and . This also ensures that any effect of the
    lamps on the temperature of plants is similar in treated and control
    plants, and shading of sunlight is similar. This type of control is
    usually called 'control'.[]{#item:example:lamps:design:one
    label="item:example:lamps:design:one"}

Design 2

:   As above, but in addition we add a second control with unenergized
    lamps. We can compare this control to the control to assess whether
    there is any side effect related to the functioning of the lamps but
    unrelated to radiation.[]{#item:example:lamps:design:two
    label="item:example:lamps:design:two"}

Design 3

:   We add a third control with no lamps or frames. By comparing this
    control with the control with unenergized lamps we can test for the
    effect of shading by lamps and supporting
    structures.[]{#item:example:lamps:design:three
    label="item:example:lamps:design:three"}

Design 4

:   We use cellulose diacetate-filtered lamps for treatments and
    unenergized lamps for controls. In this case the effect of is
    confounded with other effects of the lamps, except for
    shading.[]{#item:example:lamps:design:four
    label="item:example:lamps:design:four"}

Design 5

:   We use cellulose diacetate-filtered lamps for treatments and no
    lamps or frames for the controls. In this case the effect of is
    confounded with all other effects of using
    lamps.[]{#item:example:lamps:design:five
    label="item:example:lamps:design:five"}

Caveat

:   When discussing very small effects of treatments and the different
    controls there is always the risk of misinterpretation as the films
    used as filters are far from perfect, there is a transition zone
    between high [absorptance]{acronym-label="absorptance"
    acronym-form="singular+short"} and high
    [transmittance]{acronym-label="transmittance"
    acronym-form="singular+short"} spanning tenths of nanometres in
    wavelength (see Figure
    [\[fig:filter:T:spectra\]](#fig:filter:T:spectra){reference-type="ref"
    reference="fig:filter:T:spectra"}). Consequently, controls will not
    be exposed to exactly the same irradiance of as treated plants.
    Usually they will be exposed to a slightly lower irradiance of plus
    a trace of .

Comparison

:   Design 1 is the simplest design that can be used to test for the
    effects of . Design 2, is preferable as it allows an assessment of
    the possible secondary effects of lamps, except for shading.
    Design 3, is rarely used, but allows an assessment all side-effects
    of lamps in addition to the effect of . Is useful in an ecological
    context where we are interested in assessing how much the
    experimental setup disrupts natural conditions. Design 4 should be
    avoided as it is unsuitable for testing the effects of radiation as
    all the different effects of the lamps are confounded with the
    effect of enhancement, except for shade. Design 5 is the worst
    possible, and should never be used.
:::

When using filters, one should take into account the side-effects of
using them. In addition to absorbing different amounts and wavelengths
of radiation, filters may have effects on visible and infra-red
irradiance. No filter transmits 100% of visible light. In addition
filters block precipitation and wind, and may increase the temperature
of the air, vegetation and soil below them. So, one should always use,
as the control for assessing effects of attenuation, a transparent
filter rather than no filter. See Box
[\[ex:filters:controls\]](#ex:filters:controls){reference-type="ref"
reference="ex:filters:controls"} for some examples of good and bad
experimental setups.

::: example*
[]{#ex:filters:controls label="ex:filters:controls"}

Case

:   We use polyester ('Mylar') film outdoors to attenuate radiation (see
    Figure
    [\[fig:filter:sunlight:spectra\]](#fig:filter:sunlight:spectra){reference-type="ref"
    reference="fig:filter:sunlight:spectra"} on page ). Our objective is
    to study the effect of solar radiation.

Design 1

:   We attenuate radiation (but not radiation) in the $-$treatment by
    filtering sunlight with a polyester film. We use as a control a film
    that transmits and . This ensures that most of the effect of the
    films on precipitation, wind and temperature is similar for treated
    and control plants. Also shading of sunlight by supporting
    structures is similar. This type of control is usually called 'near
    ambient control'.[]{#item:example:filters:design:one
    label="item:example:filters:design:one"}

Design 2

:   As above, but in addition we add a second treatment with a filter
    absorbing both - and radiation. We can compare this treatment to the
    attenuation treatment to assess whether there is an effect of
    radiation. []{#item:example:filters:design:two
    label="item:example:filters:design:two"}

Design 3

:   We add a second control without filters or frames ('ambient
    control'). By comparing this control with the near-ambient control
    we can test for the effect of filters and supporting
    structures.[]{#item:example:filters:design:three
    label="item:example:filters:design:three"}

Design 4

:   We attenuate radiation in our $-$treatment by filtering sunlight
    with a polyester film. We have as controls plots with no filters or
    supporting structures. In this case the effect of is confounded with
    other effects of the filters.[]{#item:example:filters:design:four
    label="item:example:filters:design:four"}

Caveat

:   When discussing very small effects of treatments and the different
    controls there is always the risk of misinterpretation as the films
    used as filters are far from perfect, there is a transition zone
    between high [absorptance]{acronym-label="absorptance"
    acronym-form="singular+short"} and high
    [transmittance]{acronym-label="transmittance"
    acronym-form="singular+short"} spanning tenths of nanometres in
    wavelength (see Figure
    [\[fig:filter:T:spectra\]](#fig:filter:T:spectra){reference-type="ref"
    reference="fig:filter:T:spectra"} on page ). Consequently, near
    ambient controls will not be exposed to exactly the same irradiance
    of as plants under the -attenuation treated plants. Usually they
    will be exposed to a slightly lower irradiance of plus a trace of
    long wavelength .

Comparison

:   Design 1 is the simplest design that can be used to test for the
    effects of . Design 2, is preferable as it allows us to also assess
    the effects of solar radiation. Design 3, is not always used, but
    allows to assess all side-effects of filters in addition to the
    effect of radiation. This design is useful in an ecological context
    where we are interested in assessing how much our experimental setup
    disrupts natural conditions. Design 4 should be avoided as it is
    unsuitable for testing the effects of radiation as all the different
    effects of the filters are confounded with the effect of
    attenuation.
:::

In the case of controlled environments, various combinations of lamps
and filters are used to create different radiation treatments. As
discussed above, if in order to test for effects of radiation, exposure
should be the only difference between treatment and control conditions.
For example, one can have a sun simulator, or at least a combination of
lamps providing both - and visible radiation and then have different
filters between the lamps and plants. The same principles as discussed
in Examples

### Recommendations for outdoor experiments {#sec:recommend:outdoor:manip}

In this section we list recommendations related to the manipulation of
radiation in outdoor experiments, and in section
[8.6.2](#sec:recommend:indoor:manip){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:recommend:indoor:manip"} list some additional
recommendations on radiation manipulations inside greenhouses and
controlled environments. See section
[9.15](#sec:recommend:quantifying){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:recommend:quantifying"} for recommendations on how to
quantify radiation, section
[10.9](#sec:recommend:grow){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:recommend:grow"} for recommendations about growing
conditions, and section
[11.12](#sec:recommend:stat){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:recommend:stat"} for recommendations about statistical
design of experiments.

1.  Make sure that the only difference between the treatments you
    compare is what you want to test. If possible make measurements of
    the environmental conditions in the different treatments and report
    them in your publications.

    1.  In experiments with lamps avoid differences in irradiance among
        treatments. Such confounding differences can be caused by shade
        from lamps and the frames supporting them if they are kept at
        different heights. All treatments must have lamps that are
        switched on or off, covered with different filters or dimmed to
        different radiance values.

    2.  In experiments with filters avoid difference in irradiance and
        scattering. Filters used to block radiation and the frames
        supporting them have some attenuating and scattering effect on .
        All treatments must have similar supporting structures, be
        positioned at the same height, and the filters themselves must
        have as similar as possible transmittance in regions of the
        spectrum outside the region. All filters must have as similar as
        possible light scattering properties, as even if irradiance is
        the same, differences in the proportion of diffuse light affects
        the growth of plants.

    3.  In experiments with lamps avoid differences in temperature among
        treatments. Keep the distance between lamps and the top of the
        plants at least 0.4--0.5 m. If enclosures like open-top chambers
        are used, provide enough ventilation or cooling to remove the
        heat generated by the lamps.

    4.  In experiments with filters avoid differences in temperature
        among treatments. The main factor to consider in this case is
        ventilation and distance from the film to the top of the plants.
        An additional factor is the transmittance of the different films
        to longwave infra-red radiation. The filters can affect the
        temperatures both during the day and at night. If possible,
        measure the temperature of the plants and soil, in addition to
        the temperature of the air.

    5.  In experiments with filters avoid artifacts caused by
        plasticisers used in some plastic films used as filters. Ensure
        good ventilation and if possible avoid using cellulose diacetate
        films for near-ambient controls. When not using lamps there is
        no need to remove radiation and consequently the more stable and
        less toxic PTFE (Teflon) or polythene films should be used
        instead.

2.  In experiments with lamps do not use unfiltered lamps. Most lamps
    also emit some that must be filtered with a cellulose diacetate
    filter in treated plots. Most lamps also emit , so an additional
    control should be included in all experiments. This control is
    achieved by filtering out both and radiation by means of polyester
    film. The smallest well designed experiment should include three
    treatments:

3.  If the difference between near-ambient controls and true ambient
    conditions is of interest, then an additional true ambient control
    should be included to test how big is the effect of the small
    differences in air, soil and leaf temperatures, irradiance, air
    humidity and any other side-effect of the manipulations. In any
    case, when designing an experiment we should strive to minimize
    shading, alterations in temperature and ventilation.

4.  In experiments with lamps, if at all possible, use modulated systems
    that avoid unrealistic ratios between - and irradiances. If the use
    of a modulated system is impossible, keep the lamps on only a few
    hours centred on solar noon and switch them off during cloudy
    weather.

5.  In experiments with lamps use high frequency electronic ballasts
    rather than electromagnetic ballasts to drive the lamps, so as to
    avoid flicker in the radiation output, which can affect insect
    behaviour.

6.  In all experiments using filters check periodically whether the
    spectral characteristics of the filters have changed and replace
    them when needed. Cellulose diacetate degrades particularly fast
    and, for example when used at about 0.3 m from lamps it should be
    replace after about 50 h of lamp irradiation. If wrapped on lamps,
    it should be replaced even more frequently. These times are
    approximate and can also be extended when using modulated systems.

7.  In experiments using filters to attenuate in sunlight, even if the
    filters are not yet degraded or if they are made of stable materials
    like glass or PFTE (Teflon) the transmission characteristics will
    change by the accumulation of dust, dirt and pollen. If this
    happens, the filters should be cleaned or replaced.

### Recommendations for experiments in greenhouses and controlled environments {#sec:recommend:indoor:manip}

Many of the recommendations in section
[8.6.1](#sec:recommend:outdoor:manip){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:recommend:outdoor:manip"} can be adapted to apply to
indoor experiments. Here we list additional recommendations applicable
to experiments in greenhouses and controlled experiments.

1.  Keep the balance between irradiance, irradiance and as similar as
    possible to that in sunlight and/or vegetation canopies. Many growth
    chambers and growth rooms achieve relatively low irradiances of .
    Avoid using high doses of in such cabinets. Some chambers and rooms
    have sheets of polycarbonate (PC) separating the lamps from the
    plants, in such chambers levels are negligible. In chambers using
    bare lamps, irradiance is unrealistically low, but usually not equal
    to zero. A visible- and radiation spectral composition truly
    matching sunlight can be achieved only with sun simulators.

2.  Unless you are specifically studying the effect of step changes in
    irradiance, for annual plants we recommend that the treatment starts
    at the time of seed germination or earlier, and for perennial plants
    before budburst.

3.  In greenhouses, depending on the cladding material used, the and
    irradiances will differ from those outdoors. Irradiances of and are
    always somewhat lower than outdoors as the cladding materials and
    the structure of the greenhouse absorb part of the radiation.

4.  Be aware that even though the temperature may be adequate for
    growing plants in a greenhouse during the winter, light and
    especially irradiances are much lower than in the summer, even when
    high pressure sodium or metal halide lamps are used to increase
    levels. For this reason, in experiments with lamps the balance
    between and can become very different to that under natural
    conditions.

5.  Of course, if you are not interested in what happens under natural
    conditions but are researching the management of crops under cover,
    then you only have to make sure that your treatments match what can
    be achieved in commercial production systems.

## Appendix: Calculating the radiation field under an array of lamps {#sec:calc:light:field}

This section includes code for calculating the radiation field under
different arrays of lamps (Figures
[\[fig:position:tubes\]](#fig:position:tubes){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:position:tubes"} and
[\[fig:position:tubes:square\]](#fig:position:tubes:square){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:position:tubes:square"}). The algorithm is that in the
BASIC program in @Bjorn1993a with a few changes related to the density
of grid points used, and the area of the grid for which the light field
is calculated. The grid area is expanded as it is also important to
assess the distance at which neighbouring arrays can be located. Please,
see @Bjorn1993a for the details of the algorithm. The algorithm assumes
that there are no reflecting surfaces near the array, so it is better
suited for simulating the light field under arrays of lamps located
outdoors, than for those located in controlled environments.

The functions are in the R package 'lamps' which is available from the
handbook web site. The following example also uses package ggplot2,
available from CRAN (comprehensive R archive network, at
<http://cran.r-project.org/> and many mirror sites). The first example
(Box [\[box:light:field:R\]](#box:light:field:R){reference-type="ref"
reference="box:light:field:R"}) is for calculating and plotting the
radiation field under and array of fluorescent tubes, using mostly the
defaults. See the package documentation for the many function arguments
available. The second example shows how to draw the positions of the
fluorescent tubes (Box
[\[box:tube:positions:R\]](#box:tube:positions:R){reference-type="ref"
