## Introduction {#introduction-1}

By applying the most constant growth conditions that we can in an
experiment, we try to minimise uncontrolled variation in our measured
plant data, even though this is not always achieved even with identical
climate chamber protocols [@Massonnet2010]. However, by growing plants
in stable controlled environments we will also induce differences in
their response to any given stress, since natural variation in the
outdoor climate contributes to plants' ability to cope with stress.
Plants grown in climate chambers are "softer" than plants grown in
greenhouses, that are themselves "softer" than plants grown outdoors.
This softness can be expressed as weaker stems, physically softer leaves
with less developed cuticles, and a lessened ability to regulate their
stomata.

Any protected cultivation will invariably differ from natural outdoor
conditions, and the relative importance of these differences in aspects
of the climate will vary between controlled and natural environments.
The most pronounced difference is the constancy of a created climate
under protected cultivation---and the lack of wind and UV-B radiation!
In experiments in greenhouses during the winter and in growth chambers,
the amount of radiation received by plants will be far less than they
get in summer outside when most plants are active. This is unrealistic,
unless dealing with obligate shade species.

## Greenhouses

Greenhouses come in many shapes and materials throughout the world. For
plant production the cladding material can be either glass or plastic.
Normal glass is opaque to UV-B and only expensive quartz glass allows
UV-B to penetrate. The latter is used in only a few places where
near-ambient UV-B radiation is considered important for ecophysiological
research, but the vast majority of glasshouses provide no natural UV-B
inside. The use of plastic opens several opportunities for choosing
materials that are transparent to UV-B. Plastics are available as opaque
and UV-transparent films that transmit \<1% or \>70% of the radiation \<
400 nm, respectively. They can be clear (transmitting 87--90% of PAR) or
milky to diffuse the light (transmitting 85% of PAR). transparent films
are yet primarily used for increasing the vegetable quality in
horticultural production in warmer climates.

This chapter will by no means give complete instructions on how to
manage the climate in a greenhouse, but we have gathered some
information about possible technical solutions to various climate
problems and some tips and tricks from personal experience. Greenhouses
are available that provide different technical solutions for controlling
the climate. In this section we will focus on glass greenhouses with
fully automatic climate control regulated by a climate computer. The
topic of how to apply from lamps has already been covered in section
[8.2](#sec:UV:radiation:sources){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:UV:radiation:sources"} on page .

### Temperature

It is technically easier to heat than to cool a greenhouse and it is
therefore easier to maintain a stable temperature during cold times of
the year than during warm weather. As long as the boiler and heating
system are correctly set-up and able to cope with the maximum expected
temperature difference between outside and inside, the temperature
should remain close to the point set by the thermostat. The amount of
variation around the set point will depend on the sensitivity of the
on/off signal to the boiler from the thermostat that regulates the
heating system. Where winters are particularly cold, some greenhouses
require insulation screens to enable them to maintain e.g. air
temperature.

Greenhouses with conventional air conditioning are not common due to
their high running costs, so cooling is normally done by passive
ventilation, misting systems or fans with cooling pads. Passive cooling
involves opening vents and/or using shade screens to decrease heat load
from the sun. The temperature outside will naturally have a huge impact
on the degree of cooling achieved by ventilation and, if the shade
screens are used for cooling, it is important to keep a 10% gap between
them to allow air circulation out of the greenhouse.

In a closed greenhouse in sunshine strong temperature gradients can be
created. When the temperature at the floor level is ca. 25, it may be
30just 35 cm above the floor and \>50just under the ridge of the roof. A
few horizontal fans with moderate rotation in the ceiling can mitigate
the problem. Regardless if fans are used or not it is important that the
climate sensors connected to the climate computer are placed close to
the plants since the plants respond to the microclimate in the canopy,
not the macroclimate somewhere else in the greenhouse. It is also
crucial that the temperature sensor is shielded from direct heat
radiation from the sun or lamps to ensure that the true air temperature
is measured.

Water-based cooling systems use the principle of evaporative cooling. As
water evaporates, some sensible heat from the warm air is transferred to
the water as latent heat during its vaporisation. These cooling systems
work best in areas with low to moderate air humidity. Misting systems
can decrease the air temperature by some in moderate humidity and can be
constructed with or without fans. It is important that they create
droplets that are small enough to evaporate completely before they have
fallen down onto the plants. "Rain" under misting systems will
drastically increase the risk of fungal disease on plants.

Fans with cooling pads regulate temperature using large industrial fans
mounted in series with pads where water trickles down an enlarged
surface (e.g. corrugated fibreboard, wood shavings or wheat straw),
which enhance the area for evaporation. The change in latent heat in the
evaporated water leads to a corresponding decrease in air temperature.

### Light

Greenhouse conditions should mimic the outdoor conditions of the open
landscape as much as possible. The light environment in a greenhouse is
strongly dependent on how much shade is created by its structure. Modern
greenhouses are constructed to keep shading to a minimum.

The amount of radiation received by the plants can be increased by using
lamps and decreased by using shade screens but regardless of technical
installations it will be difficult to create summer light conditions in
a greenhouse during the winter in latitudes covering most of Europe.
During the summer in Denmark daily integrals of PAR vary in the range of
ca. 10--30 between rainy and sunny days inside a greenhouse without
shade screens, while the values in mid-winter are 0.5--5 with some use
of supplemental light until 22:00 h in the evening (Figure
[\[fig:ppfd:greenhouse\]](#fig:ppfd:greenhouse){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:ppfd:greenhouse"}).

:::

Modern greenhouses have two or three screens for different purposes
(shade, insulation, blackout) but in most greenhouses one shade screen
can perform a dual function in insulation as well as shading radiation.
The shade screen may also differentially remove part of the radiation,
allowing the user to decide what fraction of the radiation load to
remove up to the maximum shading with the screen fully closed. In many
cases, the principal role of shade screens is to decrease the heat load
from the sun, preventing the greenhouse from getting too hot, or as
insulation screen during the cold season, but we should bear in mind
that the light environment created by a medium-to-dense screen is
comparable to that of an overcast day i.e. the PAR is decreased by
10--90%, depending on screen material.

For plants whose flowering is controlled by day length, blackout screens
can be used to give short day treatments and incandescent bulbs (low
red:far-red photon ratio) for night interruption to achieve long day
treatments[^32]. Either a single pulse, or multiple pulses---e.g. 5 min
per hour---can be used in practice. In this way flowering can either be
induced or plants kept in a vegetative state for both short- or long-day
plants. For the treatment to work, the blackout screens must provide
completely black conditions without gaps, since phytochrome responds to
extremely small amounts of light, and even small cracks between screens
would be enough to interrupt the night length signal.

During the winter season, supplemental light from lamps is needed for
most species grown in greenhouses at high latitudes. Most greenhouses in
these regions are supplied with high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps, which
give a spectrum from blue to red but predominantly emit orange light
(Figure
[\[fig:HPS:greenhouse\]](#fig:HPS:greenhouse){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:HPS:greenhouse"}). For photosynthesis, this spectrum is
not optimal but when it is combined with natural daylight most plants
grow without any problems. In research greenhouses, high-pressure lamps
based on elements other than sodium are also used to give more "white"
light. However, they are not used for plant production because of their
lower energy efficiency than HPS lamps.

:::

Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are currently being developed to provide
greenhouse lighting. They come in many different colours, and can emit
anything from a narrow to a broad range of wavelengths. For use in
greenhouses, numerous small companies have developed various LED lamps
but up to now (summer 2012) large companies like Philips and Osram have
as yet only released LED modules for use in growth chambers and for
interlighting rows of vegetable crops (long narrow LED units placed
between rows of e.g. tomatoes and cucumbers grown in greenhouses). Top
light, or "ordinary" greenhouse LED lamps, will require LEDs that are
sufficiently efficient to emit enough radiance while incorporating
cooling for their electronics. These two factors have to be included in
the "budget" when the energy efficiency is calculated for new LED lamps
compared to traditional HPS lamps. Both the energy efficiency and
lifetime of LEDs will decrease if their electronics are overheated.

Research on the spectral distribution of LED lamps is focusing on red
light (which requires the least energy to produce per photon) and how
much additional blue or white light needs to be added for good plant
growth. One basic problem with this approach is that the human eye is
most sensitive to green and yellow and less so to blue and red light.
Since the colour of leaves is based on reflected wavelengths, leaves
that are only illuminated by blue and red light, which is efficiently
absorbed by chlorophyll, will appear as dark objects. It may distort our
judgments of plant health and nutritional status when making
comparisons, since it is often manifested as yellow chlorosis or reddish
coloration of the leaves. One would guess that the technical development
of specific greenhouse lamps will lead to red enriched LED lamps with
some blue and white (or green) LEDs to improve colour recognition.

Beyond their spectral composition, the main difference between LED and
HPS lamps is that the latter produce heat radiated in the direction of
the plants while the former do not. This means that the leaf temperature
will be higher under HPS lamps than under LED lamps. However, the
electronics of the LEDs do become warm. When using only one row of
low-efficiency LEDs, the metal mounts for the LED modules often provide
enough heat sink to prevent them from over heating (which would
otherwise decrease their efficiency), whereas high-efficiency LEDs
require cooling. Most early LED illumination for greenhouses was
water-cooled and this is one reason that its use in greenhouses has not
yet been very widespread. Currently there are some high-power LED lamps
available that are passively cooled by convection (Figure
[\[fig:LEDs:greenhouse\]](#fig:LEDs:greenhouse){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:LEDs:greenhouse"}). Some other LED lamps with passive
cooling have been designed for research (Figure
[\[fig:LEDs:greenhouse:Philips\]](#fig:LEDs:greenhouse:Philips){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:LEDs:greenhouse:Philips"}) or with active cooling for
production (Figure
[\[fig:LEDs:greenhouse:Fionia\]](#fig:LEDs:greenhouse:Fionia){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:LEDs:greenhouse:Fionia"}). The colour of the radiation
emitted depends on the LEDs used, and there are currently two different
approaches when designing LED lamps: (1) maximising radiation output
with respect to electricity consumed, and (2) maximising plant yield and
crop quality irrespective of irradiance per unit of electrical power
consumed. Because of the present fast technical development of the LED
technology we can expect to see numerous new LED products for plant
growth on the market in the next couple of years. From the perspective
of research into the effects of UV-B in nature, the best PAR sources are
those with a spectrum similar to sunlight.

The light distribution in greenhouses can be enhanced by diffusing
glass, diffusing plastic films or thin diffusing screens. These create a
more even distribution of light and decrease the differences, such as
light gradients or patchiness, that are otherwise created by shade from
the structure. A resultant side effect of diffusers is enhanced growth
of plants due to better penetration of light into the canopy
[@Markvart2010].

Commercially-available climate computers are often connected to
photometric (lux) sensors that measure light visible to humans
($\approx$`<!-- -->`{=html}400--700 nm, see Box
[\[box:photometric:quantities\]](#box:photometric:quantities){reference-type="ref"
reference="box:photometric:quantities"} on page ), whereas
[global:rad]{acronym-label="global:rad" acronym-form="singular+short"}
is measured radiometrically (, see Table
[\[tab:Phys:Quants\]](#tab:Phys:Quants){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:Phys:Quants"} on page ) in the range 400--1100 or
400--3000 nm to provide information for the energy-related control of
greenhouses (primarily temperature). The latter is the correct way to
measure irradiance linked to climate control; whereas visible light,
related to photosynthesis and plant production, should be measured as
PAR photon irradiance or [PPFD]{acronym-label="PPFD"
acronym-form="singular+short"} (PPFD, , see Box
[\[box:quantum:quantities\]](#box:quantum:quantities){reference-type="ref"
reference="box:quantum:quantities"} on page ) or PAR (energy) irradiance
(). Modern climate computers can also be directly connected to PPFD
sensors.

When using supplemental light from various light sources extra care need
to be taken on the choice of quantum sensor since most supplemental
greenhouse lamps have a dis-continuous spectrum. Some cheaper quantum
sensors do not cover the full spectral range 400--700 nm and the sensor
may not cover the spectrum of red LED's, which can peak close to a
wavelength of 700 nm.

One should keep in mind, that moving an experiment from the field to a
greenhouse does not make it independent of the outdoor season, since the
UV-B dose should be balanced against the integrated daily PPFD if the
experiment aims to mimic outdoor conditions. Daylight varies
tremendously between winter and summer. Even with supplemental light the
PPFD of a sunny winter day in Northern Europe will only correspond to an
overcast day in the summer (Figure
[\[fig:ppfd:greenhouse\]](#fig:ppfd:greenhouse){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:ppfd:greenhouse"}). The contribution from lamps will be
less than what is found in sunlight during the summer, even under long
photoperiods (c.f. Figures
[\[fig:ppfd:lamps\]](#fig:ppfd:lamps){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:ppfd:lamps"} and
[\[fig:ppfd:greenhouse\]](#fig:ppfd:greenhouse){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:ppfd:greenhouse"}).

Except for late successional species that ecologically are adapted to
obligate shade, most plants will acclimate to the prevailing light
conditions [@Bazzaz1982]. This means changing chloroplast architecture
and the stoichiometry of the whole photosynthetic apparatus
[@Anderson1988] and thus also altering the light response of
photosynthesis.

Most experiments on light acclimation only discus the light environment
in terms of "high light" or "low light", regardless if it has been
created as % of sunlight with permanent shade screens or as a certain
PPFD in climate chambers. However, the light environment should be
described by day length, maximum PPFD and integrated daily PPFD. Not
much is known about which of the parameters of the light environment,
actually trigger acclimation of photosynthesis. The three light
parameters mentioned above have been investigated in tomato
[@VandenBoogard2001], where the day length affected the chlorophyll
concentration while the integrated daily PPFD affected the maximum rate
of fixation at light saturation, independent of what the maximum PPFD
was during the day.

If photosynthesis is being studied in greenhouses in relation to UV-B
one should be aware of the effect that the seasonal changes in daylight
has on the photosynthetic apparatus and therefore also on the growth of
the plants, when comparing different experiments conducted at different
times of the year.

### Air humidity

Air humidity is difficult to regulate in greenhouses. If few plants are
grown in a compartment the humidity tends to be low due to the large
areas of potentially cold glass and concrete that act as dehumidifiers
through condensation. If the leaf area index (LAI) is high,
transpiration will make humidity correspondingly high despite
condensation on the greenhouse surfaces.

Misting systems can increase the humidity but it is important that they
create mist, not rain. Rain or condensation on the plants will increase
the risk of fungal disease in the experimental plants.

The humidity will be higher in highly insulated than in single-glass
greenhouses, where some of the humidity will condense on the glass. High
air humidity is decreased by opening the vents at the same time as
turning on the heating system to increase the exchange of air with the
outside. The effect of dehumidifying ventilation will depend on the
outdoor weather conditions and on whether dry or moist air is entering
the greenhouse.

Using traditional climate control, the air humidity is regulated as
relative humidity (RH, %). The driving force of transpiration is the
absolute gradient of water vapour from the intercellular spaces inside
the leaf to the outside air, i.e. the water vapour pressure difference
(, Pa). As the intercellular spaces are microscopic and the cell walls
saturated with water it is assumed that the RH in the leaf is 100% at
the given leaf temperature. Since the absolute content of water vapour
in air of the same RH is strongly temperature dependent (Figure
[\[fig:water:vapour\]](#fig:water:vapour){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:water:vapour"}), the evaporative demand can differ
greatly when temperature fluctuates in the greenhouse, even if RH is
stable.

::: figure*
![image](figures/fig_water_vapour.pdf){width="\\myfigwidth"}
:::

In modern climate computers a measured quantity equivalent to VPD
(i.e. based on absolute difference in humidity, expressed as water mass
concentration, instead of difference in partial pressure) can be used
for humidity control, instead of RH. It is called delta-$\chi$
($\Delta \chi$, , or sometimes simply delta-X) and is the water deficit
from the saturated value, but expressed based on mass concentration
instead of vapour pressure. Both VPD and $\Delta\chi$ use saturated
water vapour content based on air temperature as a reference. To be
correct we need information about the canopy temperature to use VPD or
$\Delta\chi$ to estimate the true evaporative demand () as when the
leaves are transpiring their temperature will be somewhat lower than the
air temperature, due to evaporative cooling. The canopy temperature is
not easily measured but in the context of climate control the
approximation based of VPD or $\Delta\chi$ still provides a better
approximation to the true evaporative demand created by the atmosphere
in the greenhouse than RH.

Misting systems using ultrasonic humidifiers have been reported to also
generate some hydrogen peroxide and may not be appropriate in research
studies of plant growth [@Arends1988]. Although the evidence is not
strong, one should be aware of this possible undesired effect.

However, increasing air humidity in greenhouses by forced aerosolization
of water (creating small droplets by water sprays, jets, ultrasonic
nebulizers etc.) may cause different problems. These processes cause
charge separation of water droplets and thus forming high concentrations
of nano-sized ions, which can damage electronic equipment due to
electrostatic deposition. The effects of the charged droplets on plants
are not known. This effect is not seen if water is being evaporated
directly from a water surface to water vapour e.g. by trickling water in
fans with cooling pads.

### Elevated carbon dioxide concentration

Modern greenhouses have systems to supply elevated concentration to
promote crop growth. There are several possible sources of that can be
used: the three most common ones are liquid from a tank, combustion of
natural gas for production and produced when burning fossil fuels for
heat/power production, where the latter two require cleaning of the
fumes to remove and .

A major difference between elevated supplied in full-scale greenhouses
compared to open-top chambers or FACE is that the greenhouse is not
supplied continuously during daytime hours. Because of the vast volume
of a greenhouse compartment it would be very expensive to supply
elevated when the vents are open for temperature control. Therefore in
traditional greenhouse climate control elevated is given only when the
vents are closed or open by at most 5%. Ethylene contamination, which
can significantly reduce plant growth, has been reported in some
supplies and it should be removed by scrubbing if necessary
[@Morison1984].

Furthermore the isotope composition may differ in liquid compared to
natural air, which need to be checked if investigations include
measurements of the ratio e.g. in relation to water balance, and when
comparing with results in the literature.

###  Growth substrates, irrigation and fertilization

Transferring experiments indoors inevitably means growing the plants in
pots. It is important to chose a growth substrate that has both good
water holding and draining properties to meet the demand for water and
oxygen for the root system. In the horticultural greenhouse industry
peat mixtures are the most commonly used substrate in pots but also
coco-peat (granulated husks of coconuts) is used. To ensure good
aeration perlite or vermiculite is sometimes mixed into the substrate.
Since the pot volume is limited the fluctuations in water content will
be greater than in soil, as will be the fluctuations in soil
temperature. In natural soil the temperature will be both more stable
and lower than what it is in pots.

The pots are often of dark colour and they absorb heat radiation when
exposed to sunlight. In commercial production the pot density is kept
high enough to create shade between the pots and only the outer row of
pots are potentially exposed to heat radiation from the sun. In
experiments you often leave some space between the plants, not to have
excessive shade between them. During sunny days without shade the pot
temperature can easily increase to levels that are damaging to the root
system and when knocking the soil/root out of the pot of border plants
that has been exposed to direct sunlight it is not uncommon to see root
death on the exposed side of the pot. The temperature of the nutrient
solution/water also affects the root temperature. If the water is cold a
growth retarding effect can be seen on the plants. More reflections on
pot experiments are found in @Passioura2006 and a meta-analysis of the
effect of pot size on plant growth in @Poorter2012a.

Several types of watering systems exist but the most common ones are
drip irrigation and ebb/flow systems. Drip irrigation is based on thin
tubes supplying each pot with nutrient solution from a tank. In an
ebb/flow system the nutrient solution it pumped up on the bench to
1--2 cm water depth and kept there for some minutes, before being
drained off, back into the tank. This system recirculates the nutrient
solution and with commercial nutrient/watering computers the composition
is controlled by pH and electric conductivity (EC) of the solution,
topping up with stock solution or an acid to keep the nutrient
concentration and pH at desired level.

Irrigation of the plants can be done by timer or on demand. In
greenhouses plants will have different need for water dependent on the
weather. If the irrigation is done by timer without adjustment for sunny
or overcast weather there will be a risk that the plants are
over-watered during dull days or water stressed on sunny days. Both
stresses potentially affect the growth of the plants.

Watering by demand can be done by experience or by weighing the plants
and watering after a pre-determined water loss. Load cells can be
mounted under ca. 0.5 m$^2$ watering trays or under a section of a
greenhouse bench, triggering a pump in the tank with nutrient solution
via a datalogger. Since plants that grow to maturity follow a sigmoid
growth curve the watering needs to be adjusted accordingly during the
experiment, to follow the demand.

### Data logging of microclimatic variables

When working in greenhouses it is not enough to report the set points
used for the most important climate parameters. The climate in a
greenhouse needs to be measured and the observed values reported. The
optimum arrangement is to have separate sensors recording the climate to
those that are controlling the climate, but if this is not possible the
ones connected to the climate computer can be used, if they are
calibrated. Light irradiance, air temperature and humidity are the most
important parameters to record, along with concentration if it is
applied. Since the natural irradiance can fluctuate rapidly, it is
important to have a high logging frequency, e.g. every minute.
Furthermore, it is important that the temperature sensor is shielded
from direct heat radiation from the sun and the lamps, while still being
exposed to free air, e.g. in a ventilated box. For ideas on how to
construct a radiation shield for measurement of air temperature refer to
the design of weather stations (e.g. <http://www.kippzonen.com>,
<http://www.skyeinstruments.com> and may others). There are several
small dataloggers on the market, with built-in air temperature and
humidity sensors in a plastic housing. They also have to be shielded
from heat radiation when used in a greenhouse or climate chamber since
the plastic housing gradually heats up and transfers the body
temperature to the sensor---in climate chambers with metal halide lamps
errors larger than 10have been observed when no shielding was used.
Recommendations for sensors and frequency of data logging are compiled
in Table
[\[tab:growth:guidelines\]](#tab:growth:guidelines){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:growth:guidelines"}.

## Open top chambers and FACE

Open top chambers (OTC) and, less frequently, closed top chambers (CTC)
are used to study the effects of elevated concentration and temperature.
Most of these chambers are built using plastic films, plates, or glass
that absorb radiation and sometimes also some radiation. In some cases,
attenuation of radiation has been minimised by use of -transparent
materials in OTCs and CTCs [e.g. @Visser1997a]. In contrast to OTCs and
CTCs, free air enhancement (FACE) systems do not significantly affect or
visible radiation. In some cases, lamps have been used in OTCs and the
attenuation measured. In controls with unenergised lamps, daily
integrals of and radiation, and were reduced by 24% [@Booker1992].

## Controlled environments

In controlled environments the spectral distribution of the light
emitted by the lamps used is especially important since there is no
contribution from natural light. A skewed spectrum can cause strange
growth patterns in plants and many lamp types produce distinct emission
bands, interrupted by bands of very low emission (Figure
[\[fig:spectra:PAR:lamps\]](#fig:spectra:PAR:lamps){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:spectra:PAR:lamps"}). Fluorescent tubes and HPS lamps, in
particular, emit very little far-red and produce plants with very
stunted growth, compared to lamps that create a continuous spectrum
resembling sunlight [@Hogewoning2010]. However, lamps emitting a
continuous spectrum can also create unexpected differences in plants
compared to sunlight. An unpublished example is that of white cabbage
grown in pots outdoors then moved into a climate chamber with metal
halide bulbs (see Figure
[\[fig:spectra:PAR:lamps\]](#fig:spectra:PAR:lamps){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:spectra:PAR:lamps"}), which developed a distinct red
coloration after a couple of hours at constant light.

lamps emit some blue light providing a weak visual indicator that the
lamp is turned on, but the contribution to the light environment will be
minor in comparison to the overall from the main lamps used for . They
also emit very small amounts of orange-red radiation.

Most lamps presently used also emit a substantial amount of heat
radiation. Some of this heat should be removed using a heat filter. The
most efficient design to achieve this is to have the lamps in a
separate, ventilated compartment in the ceiling, divided from the growth
chamber by a transparent glass/plexi-glass sheet. Even so, it is
important that the temperature sensor measuring air temperature in a
climate chamber is shielded from the heat radiation from the lamps.
Water is a good absorber of infra-red radiation, and sometimes a
transparent tray with circulating water[^33] is used as a barrier
between lamps and the plant compartment. Most lamp types (e.g. metal
halide) used in climate chambers can only be turned on/off, not dimmed.
To create different photon irradiances the lamps has to be turned on in
different constellations. Even though daylight shows strong and fast
variations in irradiance (Figure
[\[fig:light:regime:clouds\]](#fig:light:regime:clouds){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:light:regime:clouds"} on page ) the overall light pattern
is bell shaped. To mimic natural light conditions a gradual or stepwise
change during the morning/evening hours is preferred. If it is possible
to get e.g. 600 from the lamps, a 14 h-long day will give an integrated
of 30 , which corresponds to a sunny day in May in Denmark (Figures
[\[fig:ppfd:greenhouse\]](#fig:ppfd:greenhouse){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:ppfd:greenhouse"} and
[\[fig:ppfd:lamps\]](#fig:ppfd:lamps){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:ppfd:lamps"}). With the present development of the LED
technology the first climate chambers with LED lighting have been
introduced to the market, and one can expect that LEDs will be used
extensivelly for controlled environments in the future. LEDs can be
dimmed without any drastic changes in their spectral profile and the
lack of heat radiation in the direction of the plants removes one
complicating factor for lighting in climate chambers. Figure
[\[fig:spectra:PAR:lamps\]](#fig:spectra:PAR:lamps){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:spectra:PAR:lamps"} shows the photon emission spectra of
some lamps used as PAR sources in controlled environments and
greenhouses.

:::

In climate chambers it is often possible to create a fast change between
the day and night temperatures, though this is unnatural to plants.
Under natural conditions a 5--10decrease in air temperature normally
takes hours, allowing e.g. the membrane fluidity to follow. If the
temperature drop between day and night is big and fast some plants may
experience transient stress linked to membrane fluidity, which would not
be the case if the change were slower. This is something to bear in
mind, when designing the chamber climate. It can also increase the risk
of fungal disease if the air humidity is high and the plants become
damp, in the same way as in greenhouses.

If experiments are done at low or high temperatures there may be
restrictions on how well humidity can be controlled. At low temperature
there may be limitations on the capacity for dehumidification and at
high temperatures it may not be possible to sufficiently moisten the
air.

Numerous plant species lose the ability to effectively regulate their
stomata when grown at constant high humidity (ca. 70% RH at 20--25). To
our knowledge, this has been observed in , , and . These plants lose
their ability to regulate stomatal conductance when subsequently exposed
to low air humidity e.g. if moved from the greenhouse to a laboratory
for measurements of photosynthesis. In the worse case scenarios, the
plants transpire to such an extent that small local spots of necrosis
develop on the patch where gas exchange has been measured on the leaf.
However, since results like these are considered as failed experiments
such observations have not (to our knowledge) been scientifically
published. Nevertheless, it is important to be aware of this potential
problem when working with mesophytic leaves, i.e. "average" leaves that
are adapted neither to dry nor to wet conditions, like the examples
above.

Data logging of the climate is needed in controlled environments to
catch irregularities and failings in the climate control. This is
especially important to test for differences among chambers when the
climate set points changes. The Committee on Controlled Environment
Technology and Use under the USDA has issued recommendations for data
logging of growth chamber climate, which are compiled, with some
changes, in Tables

## Material issues in greenhouses and controlled environments

A potentially problematic issue concerning materials in greenhouses and
climate chambers relates to the use of different types of soft plastic
materials. Plastics like cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate or PVC are
stiff by nature. It is only when they are mixed with a softener i.e. a
"plasticiser" that they become soft and flexible. The plasticisers may
be different alkyl esters of phthalic acid. Some of these phthalates are
phytotoxic, particularly butyl phthalate (DBP) and di-isobutyl phthalate
(DIBP) [@Hannay1986; @Millar1986]. The phytotoxicity is evident as poor
growth, chlorosis, necrosis and plant death. At regular intervals since
the 1950's there have been examples in the greenhouse industry and plant
research facilities where new plastics have been introduced for
different purposes, which have caused serious growth problems
[@Hardwick1987]. Many species are damaged by phthalates but species of
Brassicaceae seem to be particularly sensitive. Past examples of
products responsible for phytotoxic problems include plastic tunnels,
water hoses, drip irrigation tubes, plastic plant pots, glazing strips
(that seal between the glass and aluminium frames in the greenhouse
construction), plastic insulation of electrical wires and plastic
boots---the latter creating growth problems in a greenhouse outside a
staff changing room. Many of these problems have been created when the
recipes or composition of products already in use in a greenhouse have
been changed by the manufacturer. Growth chambers require some fresh air
inlet for the climate control. There is an example of poor growth and
bleaching of plants in a climate chamber when the air inlet was close to
the ventilation outlet of a chemistry laboratory. When the air inlet was
moved 200 m away and supplied with a compressor, the problem
disappeared.

## Gas-exchange cuvettes and chambers

Measurement of photosynthesis through gas-exchange with present requires
modifications of most standard equipment. Most gas-exchange cuvettes
have windows that attenuate radiation. This means that most leaf
photosynthesis and stomatal conductance measurements are done in the
absence of radiation, even when done in sunlight. Stomata have been
shown to respond to radiation [e.g. @Eisinger2000], and at high
irradiances the rate of photosynthesis can also be affected [see
@Rozema1997d for a consice review].

For example, the GFS-3000 system from Walz, can be ordered with cuvette
windows made of quartz instead of normal glass. Some cuvettes for the
LI-COR LI-6400 use a plastic film as a window, and it is possible to use
an -transparent material. The cuvette for CIRAS-2 from PP Systems is
delivered with Calflex heat filter glass as standard, but can easily be
fitted with quartz glass for transmission on request.

Frequently used light sources are tungsten-halogen lamps, which emit
very little radiation, or light sources based on red LEDs in combination
with blue or white LEDs, which do not emit any radiation.

When designing experiments, especially when leaves or shoots are
enclosed for more than a couple of minutes in a gas-exchange cuvette,
one should be aware that the leaves or shoots may be in an unnatural
light environment, even when measurements are done in full sunshine. To
avoid surprises, always measure irradiance and especially spectral
irradiance through the cuvette window, rather than outside the cuvette,
if you want to describe the radiation environment during measurements.

Plastic and rubber used for tubing have different properties of
permeability to and water vapour, and absorption of water, which can
lead to flawed gas-exchange data. These properties are listed in
@Long1987.

## Plants in the field

One important disturbance in experiments on natural vegetation or field
crops is that produced by the researchers themselves. Some ecosystems
like peat bogs get more easily damaged than others, but in most cases
special precautions are needed whenever repeated access to plots is
needed. The most common approach is to use catwalks made from wooden
planks raised some centimetres above the ground. Sometimes when access
is needed to the centre of the plots ladders are put temporarily, laying
horizontally bridging two catwalks. Figure
[\[fig:catwalks:Abisko\]](#fig:catwalks:Abisko){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:catwalks:Abisko"} shows some examples from Abisko and
Figure
[\[fig:filters:photo:field1\]](#fig:filters:photo:field1){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:filters:photo:field1"} on page shows an example from
Ushuaia.

:::

Not only the spectrum, but also the temporal variation of irradiance
differs between controlled environments and natural conditions. The
temporal light regime depends on the position of the sun and on clouds
(Figure
[\[fig:light:regime:clouds\]](#fig:light:regime:clouds){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:light:regime:clouds"}), and also on the vegetation itself
(Figure
[\[fig:light:regime:sapplings\]](#fig:light:regime:sapplings){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:light:regime:sapplings"}). For experiments done in the
field summaries of data from an in situ or nearby weather station should
be used to describe the growing conditions. To assess the light
environment at different locations in a forest understorey,
hemispherical photographs taken with a fish-eye lens, can be used. There
is software available---e.g. Hemiview from Delta-T---that allows the
prediction of the light environment based on the position of the sun in
the sky at different times of the day and seasons of the year.

## Cultivation of aquatic plants

When designing experimental set ups for the cultivation of aquatic
plants under full solar radiation (+ + ) or under a simulated natural
radiation field (see section
[8.4](#sec:manipulating:aquatic){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:manipulating:aquatic"} on page ), the spectral
transmission of the vessels or photobioreactors used must be accounted
for as well as the absorbtion of radiation by the water, growth medium
and the aquatic plants themselves (self shading). Most studies
evaluating photosynthetic activity in algae have been conducted in
-opaque incubators and this has consequently led to overestimation of
their photosynthetic capacity, since radiation causes photoinhibition
and photodamage in aquatic plants
[@Hader1997; @Villafane2003; @Bischof2006].

The most frequently used photobioreactors have a cylindrical shape and
they can be transparent or opaque to radiation (Figure
[\[fig:culture:systems\]](#fig:culture:systems){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:culture:systems"}, see section
[8.4](#sec:manipulating:aquatic){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:manipulating:aquatic"} on page ). Some photobioreactors
are built from rigid plastic such as polycarbonate (PC),
polymethylmethacrylate (PMM) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and others
from flexible plastic such as cellulose acetate or polyethylene.

The aims of photobioreactor design are:

::: inparaenum
high volumetric productivity (g l$^{-1}$ d$^{-1}$),

high productivity per unit area (g m$^{-2}$ d$^{-1}$)

high cell concentration (g l$^{-1}$)

high efficiency in the conversion of light (g
mol$_\mathrm{photons}^{-1}$)

high biomass quality

sustainable and reliable cultivation, and

low construction and operating costs.

The material for the photostage of the photobioreactors must have:

high transparency,

![image](photos/fig_large_tanks_1.pdf){width="0.8\\myfigwidth"}

Seaweeds can be also cultivated in large tanks (500--1000 l) made of
materials such as polyethylene, glass-fibre-reinforced polyester or
polypropylene---which all attenuate radiation (Figure
[\[fig:large:tanks:photos\]](#fig:large:tanks:photos){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:large:tanks:photos"}). Thus when and visible radiation
are supplied by artificial lamps, they must be located above the open
top of the tanks. Likewise when tanks receive natural solar radiation,
[direct:rad]{acronym-label="direct:rad" acronym-form="singular+short"}
is available within the tank only at high solar elevation angles,
whereas [diffuse:rad]{acronym-label="diffuse:rad"
acronym-form="singular+short"} predominates during the rest of the day.
Large containers are considerably more expensive than other systems and
require an ample water supply and frequent maintenance. Facilities
originally designed for other purposes, e.g. biofiltration of fishpond
effluents, are often used for the incubation of aquatic plants
[@Neori1996; @Figueroa2006]. These tanks can be placed outdoors under
full solar radiation or enclosed inside a greenhouse.

In tanks, incident radiation is generally attenuated very rapidly and
attenuation depends largely on algal density, the shape and volume of
the tanks and the amount and type of particulate and dissolved material
in the water. If we compare the irradiance at different depths in the
water with different regions of the light-response curve of
photosynthesis, we can see that PAR irradiance can be high enough to
cause photoinhibition in the surface layer (Figure
[\[fig:photosynthesis:in:tanks\]](#fig:photosynthesis:in:tanks){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:photosynthesis:in:tanks"}). The smallest irradiance
causing photoinhibition is denoted in the graph as Q~h~ while the
irradiance incident at the surface of the water is Q~0~. In the next
layer below the surface, the incident irradiance is lower than Q~h~ but
higher than saturating irradiance for photosynthesis (Q~s~). About
80--90% of photons reach this layer of maximal production. The
irradiance in the layer below, which is deeper than the layers above, is
lower than saturating irradiance but higher than
light-compensation-point irradiance (Q~c~)[^34]. Finally the irradiance
in the deepest layer at the bottom of the tank is lower still Q~c~, this
is considered to be a 'dark' layer (in general 70% of the volume of the
tank). Thus, it is crucial that the algae are vigorously circulated
through the tanks using air to maintain a light:dark regime adequate for
growth, i.e. the algae move from the bottom of the tanks, where the
tubes injecting the air are located, to the upper layers, where photon
irradiance is higher.

To cultivate both fixed or free floating aquatic plants, the plants must
receive air (with or without enrichment) in addition of light and
nutrients. Air not only serves as a carbon source but also produces the
turbulent environment needed to provide nutrients to the algae, which
under a laminar regime would be less available to some of the algae
leading to their starvation. Thus, the suitable movement of macrophytes
within the tank results, not only in their adequate exposure to PAR and
radiation, but also the provision of nutrition and gas exchange. Thus,
the appropriate balance between the initial inoculum and the water
volume should be accurately calculated. Due to circular movement of
water within a tank, macrophytes are often exposed to variable light
conditions or, when densities are high, to self-shading. The cultivation
of subtidal seaweeds in outdoor tanks can cause bleaching or chronic
photoinhibition because they are not normally exposed to high
irradiances of . These effects of high irradiance can mask the effects
of radiation. This can be avoided by the use of neutral shading screens
that minimise the undesirable effects of excessive light, as exemplified
in a tank cultivation of three seaweeds from the coast of Baja
California [@CabelloPasini2000]. By neutral screens, we mean grey or
black shade-cloth that has little or no effect on the radiation
spectrum, attenuating all wavelengths by the same relative amount. When
using more than one layer of shade-cloth, remember that the effect is
multiplicative rather than additive. For example two layers of a cloth
with a 50% transmittance each will yield a transmittance of
approximately 25%.

As an example, in cultures of in semitransparent polyethylene tanks, the
high algal biomass density caused a drastic reduction in the maximal
average irradiance at 10 cm depth compared to that at the surface
[@Figueroa2008]. At 10 cm depth, was reduced by about 87.5% at an algal
density of 4 g l$^{-1}$, 89.5% at 6 g l$^{-1}$ and 95% at 8 g l$^{-1}$.
The attenuation of radiation was 94% at 4 g l$^{-1}$, 96% at 6
g l$^{-1}$ and 99% at 8 g l$^{-1}$. radiation at noon was fully
attenuated by an algal density of 4 g l$^{-1}$ at 10 cm depth, while
with this same algal density there was "complete darkness" (less than
0.1% of incident irradiance) at 25 cm depth.

The shape of the tank and the ratio of surface to volume (S:V) also have
an effect on the hydrodynamics and the movement of the seaweeds (Figure
[\[fig:culture:tanks:S:V\]](#fig:culture:tanks:S:V){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:culture:tanks:S:V"}). Semicircular tanks of fibre glass
(750 l) have better hydrodynamics, not only because they allow more
water movement and a better distribution of the air bubbles in the tank,
but also because of their higher S:V ratio (2.4 m$^{-1}$) than that of
cylindric 1500 l tanks of semitransparent polyethylene (S:V = 1
m$^{-1}$) or 90 l (S:V = 2.2 m$^{-1}$).

Another aspect of good experimental design is choosing the location of
plants within the culture system, i.e. the merits of fixed- versus
free-floating aquatic plants. Both fixed and free floating aquatic
plants absorb radiation to differing extents depending on their pigment
composition and the thickness of their tissue or thallus. Aquatic
angiosperms can be anchored to both natural materials, such as stones,
and artificial materials (rows, epoxy, etc.). Seaweeds are usually
cultured in free floating systems where they are moved by the injection
of air, although in nature they are fixed to different substrates. Not
all species can be cultivated floating freely and in some cases this can
alter their growth forms, transforming branched forms into a spherical
forms. Morphological changes affect both bio-optical properties
(i.e. including absorption) and nutrient assimilation which is higher in
branched forms than spherical forms due to their higher surface:volume
ratio (of both cells and the whole plant). Thus, in photobiological
experiments, it is crucial to optimise both algal density and the light
field---by using lamps located to one side (lateral position) or above
the aquarium---so as to reduce or avoid self shading.

Mesocosms have been developed to recreate natural conditions as closely
as possible on a small scale. They are generally used to study plankton
communities, however, their use in aquatic macrophyte ecology is
increasing. For example, floating mesocosms and mesocosms connected to
land---e.g. attached to a platform or pier---have been developed (Figure
[\[fig:floating:mesocosms\]](#fig:floating:mesocosms){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:floating:mesocosms"}).

Several mesocosm studies have used ambient radiation supplemented with
radiation from fluorescent lamps to simulate an increase in radiation
due to ozone depletion. Two methodologies can be applied: (a)
supplementing a fixed irradiance value ("square wave systems"), or (b)
supplementing a fixed percentage of ambient irradiance ("modulated
systems") [@Belzile1998; @Belzile2006]. Modulated systems, which were
originally developed for terrestrial plants [@Caldwell1983], are better
than square-wave systems for simulating predicted increases in radiation
[@Diaz2003; @Diaz2006]. See section
[8.2.6](#sec:modulated){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:modulated"}
on page .

When using mesocosms, experimental designs must be as realistic as
possible in simulating forcing factors as well as their variability. For
example, when studying the effect of increased , experiments should be
designed to reproduce diurnal variations in irradiance and episodic
events such as passing clouds. Recently, experiments using mesocosms
have been applied to evaluate the interactive effects on macrophytes of
environmental shifts driven by climate changes (temperature, , radiation
and nutrient availability). To mimic climate change conditions,
@Liboriussen2005 designed a flow-through mesocosm in a shallow lake
which can also be applied to other aquatic ecosystems. Recently, a new
automatically-operated system providing accurate simulations of the
increases in radiation and temperature according to climate change
scenarios has been developed [@Nouguier2007]. All these systems
reproduce the sort of high degree of environmental variability inherent
to aquatic systems.

##  {#sec:recommend:grow}

In this section we list recommendations related to the cultivation of
plants used in experiments studying the effects of radiation. See
sections [8.6.1](#sec:recommend:outdoor:manip){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:recommend:outdoor:manip"} and
[8.6.2](#sec:recommend:indoor:manip){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:recommend:indoor:manip"} for recommendations on
manipulation of radiation, section
[9.15](#sec:recommend:quantifying){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:recommend:quantifying"} for recommendations on how to
quantify radiation, and section
[11.12](#sec:recommend:stat){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:recommend:stat"} for recommendations about statistical
design of experiments.

1.  Include in the methods description in your publications enough
    information about the growing conditions so that the experiment can
    be duplicated.

2.  When using growth chambers, growth rooms, or greenhouses with
    environmental control systems report in addition to model and
    manufacturer and its address, all the settings used:

    1.  Temperature

    2.  Air humidity

    3.  Lamps.

    4.  Shade/insulation screens.

    5.  supply

    6.  Pots, soil and fertilization.

    7.  Watering.

    8.  Plant material

3.  Check the calibration of the climate sensors that control the
    greenhouse or controlled environment. For example, PAR sensors
    should be calibrated once a year, infrared gas analysers (IRGAs)
    used in control once every week or two (but depends on the
    instrument, so follow the manufacturer recommendations). Electronic
    thermometers and capacitive air humidity sensors (such as Vaisala
    HUMICAP) should be checked a few times per year, and recalibrated
    when needed.

4.  Program the data logger for logging each minute, either a separate
    logger with sensor or the climate logging function of the climate
    computer using the same sensors as are controlling the climate. If
    you use a separate battery-powered datalogger, the data record will
    include the time during mains power interruptions or environmental
    control system failure.

## Further reading {#further-reading-2}

@Poorter2012 have written a practical guide on how to grow plants for
reproducible results, giving several examples of how variation in the
climate influence the results, including suggestions for further
reading. If biomass allocation to different plant organs is studied in
an experiment, the Tansley review by @Poorter2012b should consulted as
it presents a meta-analysis of how climate parameters other than UV-B
affect plant morphology. This is especially important if results from
different growing seasons are compared. For general introduction to the
energy, water and carbon balance of plants in relation to the climate we
refer to @Jones1992 and @Nobel2009, for climate physics in relation to
plant canopies to @Oke1988 and for more thorough calculations of the
greenhouse climate to @Bakker1995
[@Stanhill1999; @Beytes2003; @Stanghellini1987].
