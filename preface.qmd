# Preface to the 2nd edition {.unnumbered}

{{< lipsum 1-2 >}}

## Plan for the 2nd edition {.unnumbered}

::: callout-note
This is a book created using the "Quarto book" system (version 1.5). To learn more about Quarto books visit <https://quarto.org/docs/books>.
:::

The first edition was published as an outcome of the COST Action: UV4Growth. After the end of the Action, the UV4Plants Association was formed. This second edition is being produced under the auspices of the [UV4Plants Association](https://www.uv4plants.org/).

This new edition will be made available on-line as work in progress, i.e., written in the open.

The text and illustrations from the first edition are being updated to the current state of the science and the methods used in research. In addition, text and illustrations from articles published in the UV4Plants Bulletin are being updated and adapted for inclusion in the new edition.

The structure of the book is not yet final. We are following a plan, but as long chapters are unsuitable for on-line use, some of the planned chapters below are likely to be further divided. Chapters are tentatively grouped into parts, in this draft version.

**The planned chapters are:**

I. Basics

  1.  Introduction
  
  2.  Radiation and optics
  
  3.  The UV, VIS and NIR environment of plants

II. Measurements

  4.  Quantifying UV, VIS and NIR radiation

  5.  Measurement of optical properties of leaves

  6.  Quantifying plants' responses 

  7.  Imaging in UV, VIS and short IR radiation

III. Design and planning

  8.  Design, planning and data analysis from photobiological experiments

  9.  Ensuring reproducibility
  
IV. Realization and treatments

  10.  Manipulating UV and VIS radiation

  11.  Cultivation of plants for UV and other photobiological experiments
