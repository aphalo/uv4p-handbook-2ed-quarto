## Basic concepts and terminology {#sec:basic:concepts}

### Introduction to UV, VIS and NIR radiation

In this section we will discuss the quantities, units and terminology
used to describe visible and UV radiation, and explain how to use and
interpret information about radiation. We will explain the basic
concepts associated with quantifying radiation and how the different
aspects of this topic are applied to UV experimentation.

When describing experimental conditions we need to avoid all ambiguity,
so that our results can be interpreted and experiments repeated. For
this reason "Light intensity" and "amount of light", which are ambiguous
terms, should be avoided in scientific contexts unless it is made
absolutely clear what they stand for.

Radiation always consists of different wavelength components, although
we often use the term "monochromatic" when the spectral range is narrow.
Not even a single photon can be assigned an exact wavelength. As
radiation also travels in various directions, it is also always
associated with a distribution of directions. When we say
"[collimated]{acronym-label="collimated" acronym-form="singular+short"}
radiation", we mean that the angular distribution is very narrow. When
we say "[diffuse:rad]{acronym-label="diffuse:rad"
acronym-form="singular+short"}", we mean that the angular distribution
is wide. In order to fully describe radiation, we must therefore
describe the distribution of its wavelength components (the spectral
distribution) and their direction in addition to "amount". Polarization
is another property of radiation, but it will not be dealt with here.
Finally, we should consider the time dimension; radiation changes over
time. Radiation can be measured almost instantaneously and expressed as
a rate, or integrated over time. Consequently we must distinguish
between total energy, or the total number (or total number of moles) of
photons, and the energy-or-photons per unit time. The first case gives
an accumulated quantity, and the second case gives a rate. A clear
distinction should also be made between the incident radiation on a
target and the amount of radiation absorbed. When dealing with ionizing
radiation, the term "dose" is always used to mean the radiation
absorbed, however the same term often designates incident radiation when
used in connection with ultraviolet-B and visible radiation.

A comprehensive glossary of terms relating to visible and ultraviolet
radiation has been published by @Braslavsky2007. It can be downloaded
from the Internet (see link in reference list).

### Direction {#sec:basic:concepts:direction}

Daylight radiation has two components: (a) radiation arriving directly
from the sun, or [direct:rad]{acronym-label="direct:rad"
acronym-form="singular+short"}, and (b) radiation arriving from the sky,
or [diffuse:rad]{acronym-label="diffuse:rad"
acronym-form="singular+short"}. Because it is very distant compared to
its size, the sun behaves almost as a point source. For this reason
direct radiation at the Earth surface comes from a single direction, so
that its 'rays' are parallel or [collimated]{acronym-label="collimated"
acronym-form="singular+short"}. Diffuse radiation is due to scattering
and reflection in the atmosphere, and arrives from the whole sky, its
'rays' are not parallel. Diffuse radiation is not collimated.

Light meters and radiation sensors are usually calibrated using
radiation from (approximately) a single direction, i.e., collimated
radiation from a lamp, but in nature (where most plants live!) radiation
is not collimated. The solar radiation reaching the ground on clear
cloud-free days as direct sunlight is rather well collimated, but in
addition to direct radiation there is diffuse radiation from the sky.
Furthermore, radiation reflected by the ground and objects in the
surroundings also contributes to the diffuse radiation received by
plants. A plant scientist wishing to understand how plants use and react
to radiation has to take both direct and diffuse radiation into account.

Many radiation meters have a flat receiving surface, just like many
plant leaves, and so should in principle be well suited to measuring the
radiation reaching a leaf. But if we are interested in the whole plant
rather than a single leaf the situation is different, since plants are
three-dimensional not flat and different surfaces on the plant face in
different directions. In such situations where we wish to obtain an
approximate estimate of the quantity of radiation incident on a plant,
it is better to use a sphere than a flat radiation meter. This is
achieved with a measuring instrument that is equally sensitive to
radiation from any direction.

This brings us to the distinction between

1.  Irradiance, i.e., radiation power incident on a flat surface of unit
    area, and[]{#item:irradiance label="item:irradiance"}

2.  Energy fluence rate (or fluence rate for short), i.e., radiation
    power incident on a sphere of unit cross section. The term fluence
    rate was introduced by @Rupert1974.[]{#item:fluence:rate
    label="item:fluence:rate"}

Other terms with the same meaning as energy fluence rate are space
irradiance, scalar irradiance and actinic flux. The latter is used
mostly by atmospheric scientists. The term spherical irradiance has been
used in similar contexts, but means one quarter of the fluence rate.
Vectorial irradiance is just the same as irradiance.

Both irradiance and energy fluence rate, can also be described in terms
of photons. For item
[\[item:irradiance\]](#item:irradiance){reference-type="ref"
reference="item:irradiance"} above, the corresponding photon
nomenclature has not yet been standardised. It would be logical to use
the term photon irradiance, but many people, especially in the
photosynthesis field, use the term photon flux density and the
abbreviation PFD (PPFD for [PPFD]{acronym-label="PPFD"
acronym-form="singular+short"}). For item
[\[item:fluence:rate\]](#item:fluence:rate){reference-type="ref"
reference="item:fluence:rate"} the term photon fluence rate is well
accepted among plant physiologists, but hardly among scientists in
general (for example meteorologists call it 'actinic flux' or 'scalar
irradiance'). Energy fluence is the energy fluence rate integrated over
time. The word energy is frequently omitted, so that 'fluence' has the
same meaning as 'energy fluence'. In contrast, when 'photon fluence' is
meant, the word 'photon' is always explicitly mentioned.

When giving a value for irradiance, the direction of the plane for which
the irradiance is considered must be specified. This is often the
horizontal plane but will depend on the object studied: for instance,
the surface a leaf is frequently not horizontal. For
[collimated]{acronym-label="collimated" acronym-form="singular+short"}
radiation (coming from a single direction), irradiance and fluence rate
have the same numerical value if the beam of radiation is perpendicular
to the plane on which irradiance is measured (Figure
[\[fig:cosine\]](#fig:cosine){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:cosine"}.A). For completely
[isotropic]{acronym-label="isotropic" acronym-form="singular+short"}
radiation coming from above (equally from any direction above the
horizontal) the fluence rate is twice the irradiance on a horizontal
plane (Figure [\[fig:cosine\]](#fig:cosine){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:cosine"}.C). Sometimes one may also have to consider
radiation from below, especially in aquatic environments (Figure
[\[fig:cosine\]](#fig:cosine){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:cosine"}.D).

::: figure*
![image](figures/cosine_arrows.pdf){width="0.8\\myfigwidth"}
:::

When a delimited beam of radiation hits a plane surface perpendicularly,
it results in the irradiance, , but the same beam when tilted at an
angle $\alpha$ to the vertical will be more spread out, and thus the
irradiance will be lower. More specifically, the irradiance will be
$\irr \cdot \cos \alpha$ (Figure
[\[fig:cosine\]](#fig:cosine){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:cosine"}.B).

### Spectral irradiance

When we deal with *how a quantity of radiation varies with wavelength*,
for instance when plotting a spectrum, we add "spectral" to the name of
the quantity to give "spectral irradiance" and "spectral fluence rate".
We must also adjust the units to account for the width of the part of
the spectrum that is included in the value specified (in photobiology
nm$^{-1}$ is often used to indicate wavelength interval, but the scale
can also be defined in terms of wave number or frequency, as in,
cm$^{-1}$ or s$^{-1}$ respectively).

### Wavelength {#sec:basic:concepts:wavelength}

It is impractical to always quantify radiation by giving its complete
spectral composition; so simplifications have to be made that account
for the most important features of a spectrum. From a purely physical
viewpoint, there are two basic ways of quantifying radiation. Either we
express the quantity related to the number of photons, or the quantity
related to the energy of radiation. When considering radiation of a
single wavelength, the energy of a photon, or quantum (in a vacuum), is
inversely proportional to the wavelength and the proportionality
constant is Planck's constant multiplied by the speed of light in a
vacuum (see section
[7.3](#sec:radiation:properties){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:radiation:properties"}).
$$\quantum(\lambda) = h \cdot \nu = h \cdot \frac{c}{\lambda} \label{eq:photon}$$
where $\quantum(\lambda)$ is a quantum, or the amount of energy that one
photon has, $h$ is Planck's constant ($h=6.626\times 10^{-34}$ Js),
$\nu$ is frequency, $\lambda$ is wavelength, and $c$ is the speed of
light in a vacuum ($c=2.998\times 10^8$ m s$^{-1}$). Please, see section
[7.4](#sec:solar:radiation){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:solar:radiation"} on page for a numerical example. When
dealing with a band of wavelengths it is necessary to repeat these
calculations for each wavelength (in practice a very narrow band) and
only then integrate across wavelengths. For example, PAR in units of W
m$^{-2}$ is obtained by integrating the spectral irradiance from 400 to
700 nm. As explained in Box
[\[box:quantum:quantities\]](#box:quantum:quantities){reference-type="ref"
reference="box:quantum:quantities"} on page , to determine a quantity in
terms of photons, an energetic quantity has to be weighted by the number
of photons, i.e. divided by the energy of a single photon at each
wavelength from equation
[\[eq:photon\]](#eq:photon){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:photon"}.
To get moles of photons, the value has to be divided further by
Avogadro's number ($N_A=6.022\times 10^{23}$ mol$^{-1}$). For example,
the photon irradiance or in units of is obtained by
$$\PPFD = \frac{1}{N_A}\int_{400\;\mathrm{nm}}^{700\,\mathrm{nm}}\frac{\lambda}{hc}\;E(\lambda)\;\mathrm{d}\lambda \label{eq:ppfd}$$
If we have measured (energy) irradiance, and want to convert this value
to photon irradiance, the conversion will be possible only if we have
information about the spectral composition of the radiation we measured.
For , 1 of "average daylight" (400--700 nm) is approximately 4.6 . This
figure is exact only if the radiation is equal from 400 to 700 nm,
because it represents the value at the central wavelength of 550 nm. But
to make the exact conversion, we must know the spectrum of irradiance
measured at the time of measurement, as the solar spectrum varies
through the day and with the seasons. In the band this is even more
important as the tail of the solar spectrum varies much more than the
band. When dealing with lamps, we can sometimes use conversion factors
obtained for a particular sensor and lamp combination to convert
measured values from energy to photon irradiance. If the lamps are
filtered, for example with cellulose diacetate, the spectrum transmitted
by the filter will change as the filter ages, and consequently each time
irradiance beneath the filter is measured the spectrum of the radiation
source (i.e. the lamps) must also be measured.

### Units used for photons and energy

Radiation considered as photons can be expressed either as number of
photons, or as moles of photons (the symbol for moles is mol). An
obsolete term for a mole of photons is an Einstein (E); it should no
longer be used. According to Avogadro's number ($N_A$), one mole is
$6.02217 \times 10^{23}$ photons, but in most cases a more convenient
unit is $\mymu$mol (micromole of photons, $6.02217 \times 10^{17}$
photons). Either of these units can be expressed per time and per area
or (rarely in biological contexts) per volume.

The unit of energy is a joule (J). Energy per time is power, and a joule
per second is a watt (W). Both can be expressed per area (or, rarely in
biological contexts, per volume, i.e., energy density or power density).
Simply giving a value followed by "" without further qualification is
not meaningful and should be avoided, since this leaves the surface you
are expressing with m$^2$ undefined. Is it a flat surface or a curved
one? If it is flat, what is its orientation? When reporting experimental
conditions, all these factors have to be specified.

### Ratios of UV and visible radiation

As already mentioned in section
[7.1](#sec:plants:UVB){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:plants:UVB"}
on page , it is very important to conduct experiments under realistic
environmental conditions. For the control of these experimental
conditions, it is helpful---besides using
[biologically effective exposures]{acronym-label="biologically effective exposure"
acronym-form="plural+short"}---to calculate ratios and . The ratios can
also be used for comparison of different experimental conditions or
experimental conditions with natural conditions outside in the field, as
for example shown in section
[8.2.7](#sec:simulators){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:simulators"} on page and in table
[\[tab:typical:irrad:values\]](#tab:typical:irrad:values){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:typical:irrad:values"} on page . For the calculation of
these ratios, it is absolutely essential to use the same quantity of
radiation or the same weighting procedure, respectively, i.e. energetic
units or photon units, but not a mixture. The term "energetic" means
that the spectral irradiance is simply integrated over the respective
spectral band yielding units like W m$^{-2}$. For the calculation of
photon ratios it is also necessary to integrate over the respective
spectral bands, but additionally weighted by the number of photons at
each wavelength (see section
[9.1.4](#sec:basic:concepts:wavelength){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:basic:concepts:wavelength"}). A function to calculate
photon ratios in R is described in section
[9.19.4](#app:R:ratios:photon){reference-type="ref"
reference="app:R:ratios:photon"} on page .

### A practical example

The importance of indicating the type of sensor and its orientation is
exemplified by the changing ratio of fluence rate to irradiance
throughout a day (Figure
[\[fig:fluence:rate:irradiance\]](#fig:fluence:rate:irradiance){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:fluence:rate:irradiance"}). At noon, when the sun is high
in the sky the ratio is at its minimum. Even then the ratio remains
larger than one because, other than at the equator, the midday sun never
reaches the zenith and because the sensor will also always receive
diffuse radiation from the whole sky. We can say that when measuring
solar radiation the fluence rate will always be numerically larger than
the irradiance. Towards both ends of the day the ratio reaches its
maximum value because irradiance is being measured on a horizontal plane
but the sun is near the horizon. During twilight, particles in the
atmosphere will make the distribution of solar radiation more even,
allowing a relatively large area of the sky to remain bright, and the
ratio decreases again.

### Measuring fluence rate and radiance

Spherical sensors, as needed for measuring fluence rate, also called
scalar irradiance, are not common. LI-COR (Lincoln, NE, USA) sells a
spherical quantum sensor (LI-193) that can be submerged, and
Biospherical Instruments Inc. (San Diego, CA, USA) makes both PAR-
(e.g. QSL-2100 and QSL-2200, terrestrial; QSP series with models that
can be submerged to thousands of metres) and also narrowband spherical
sensors for measuring UV- and visible radiation fluence rate.
Biospherical Instruments Inc. also makes radiance sensors with input
optics that have a very narrow acceptance angle. Figure
[\[fig:AMOUR:entrance:optics\]](#fig:AMOUR:entrance:optics){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:AMOUR:entrance:optics"} shows the different entrance
optics available for one series of sensors from Biospherical
Instruments. Most broadband UV sensors and entrance optics for
spectroradiometers follow a cosine response. @Bjorn1995 describes a
method for estimating fluence rate from three or six irradiance
measurements at a series of specific angles.

:::

### Sensor output

Radiometer sensors can have either analog or digital outputs. Some
sensors with an analogue output have an amplifier next to the detector,
others do not. Sensors with an analog output are usually connected to a
voltmeter or a datalogger. Some digital sensors are really complete
radiometers with a digital output. Examples of radiometers with digital
outputs, are shown in Figure
[\[fig:AMOUR\]](#fig:AMOUR){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:AMOUR"}.
RS-232 and USB are digital interfaces frequently used to attach these
sensors to personal computers[^19].

![image](photos/amour_300.pdf){width="0.8\\myfigwidth"} 
:::

### Calibration

To calibrate radiation sensors the relationship must be determined
between the electrical signal produced by a sensor and the amount of
radiation impinging on that sensor. The physical value of irradiance, ,
of the incoming radiation in energy units, is obtained by "comparison"
of a measurement $X$ with that of a calibrated radiation source
$X_\mathrm{lamp}$,
$$\irr = \irr[lamp] \cdot \frac{X\cdot a}{X_\mathrm{lamp}}$$ where
$\irr[lamp]$ is the calibration file of the lamp provided by the
calibration survey. The factor $a$ accounts for any difference in the
lamp to sensor distance between the survey's calibration and your own
measurement of the lamp. In most modern instruments this "comparison" is
implicitly done by the software in the instrument itself, or the
computer it is attached to, by multiplying the electrical signal from
the detector with a calibration constant. If this is not the case, it is
necessary to correct all raw measurements, here $X$ and
$X_\mathrm{lamp}$, before making any further calculations, for example,
by subtracting the measurement of dark current (the sensor reading in
the dark).

Although photons can be counted using a photomultiplier and appropriate
electronics, this approach does not provide an absolute measurement.
Some photons are always missed and false counts are included due to
thermal excitation. Therefore, absolute calibration of radiation meters
can only be provided in energetic terms. For this purpose so-called
"blackbody radiators" of known temperature are used, since they depend
only on temperature for the total radiation as well as its spectral
distribution. Blackbody radiators used for the calibration of lamps, are
then available for purchase by scientists for use as secondary
standards.

In the case of broadband sensors used to measure biologically-effective
irradiances or selected bands of the spectrum, the calibration is
usually carried out by comparison to readings from a calibrated
spectroradiometer under a radiation source with a spectrum as similar as
possible to the one which will be measured with the broadband sensor
(e.g. sunlight). To calibrate spectroradiometers, in addition to a
spectral-irradiance calibration against one or more lamps (with a
continuous spectrum, such as an incandescent lamp), it is necessary to
do a wavelength calibration against the sun or a lamp (with a an
emission spectrum with discrete, narrow and stable peaks, such as a low
pressure mercury lamp).

### Further reading {#further-reading}

@Bjorn1996b treat the same subjects as this section, but in more depth.
Also the book edited by @Bjorn2007 is a good source of basic information
about radiation and photobiology.

## Actinometry

Actinometers are chemical systems for the measurement of light and
ultraviolet radiation. They do not need to be calibrated by the user,
and thus do not require the purchase of an expensive standard lamp with
an expensive power supply. Standardization has usually been taken care
of by those who have designed the actinometer. Another advantage is that
their geometry can more easily be adjusted to the measurement problem.
The shape of a liquid actinometer can be made to correspond to the
overall shape of the irradiated object under study.

In many cases, it is of interest to study a suspension or solution that
can be put in an ordinary cuvette for spectrophotometry or fluorimetry,
and the actinometer solution can be put into a similar cuvette. A large
number of actinometers have been devised. @Kuhn1989 lists, briefly
describes and gives references for 67 different systems of which they
recommend five. In general, actinometers are sensitive to short-wave
radiation ($<$`<!-- -->`{=html}500 nm) and insensitive to long-wave
radiation ($>$`<!-- -->`{=html}500 nm). Insensitivity to long-wave
radiation can be both a drawback and an advantage, but by choosing the
best actinometer for a particular purpose we can avoid their
disadvantages. One advantage of using an actinometer insensitive to long
wave radiation is that we can use it for UV work under illumination
visible to the human eye, without disturbing the measurement. Here we
shall concentrate on the most popular actinometer for ultraviolet
radiation---the potassium ferrioxalate or potassium iron(III) oxalate
actinometer. In addition to using it directly in some experiments, we
can use it for checking the calibration of other instruments, such as
spectroradiometers.

The description below is sufficient for a researcher starting to work in
the field. For more detailed information one should consult @Parker1953
[@Hatchard1956; @Lee1964; @Goldstein2008]. Complete recipes have also
been published, e.g., @Seliger1965 [@Jagger1967]. In the ferrioxalate
actinometer the following photochemical reaction is exploited:

::: centering
$\frac{1}{2}$ (COO)$_2^{2-}$ + Fe$^{3+}$ + photon $\rightarrow$ CO$_2$ +
Fe$^{2+}$\
or\
Oxalate ion + Fe(III) ion + radiation $\rightarrow$ carbon dioxide +
Fe(II) ion\
:::

The quantum yield for this reaction (i.e., the number of iron ions
reduced per photon absorbed) is slightly wavelength dependent but close
to 1.26 in the spectral region, 250--500 nm, where the ferrioxalate
actinometer is used. Usually a 1-cm layer of 0.006 M ferrioxalate
solution is used. Quantum yield and the fraction of radiation
(perpendicular to the 1 cm layer) absorbed are shown in Table
[\[tab:ferrioxlate\]](#tab:ferrioxlate){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:ferrioxlate"}.

As seen from Table
[\[tab:actinometer\]](#tab:actinometer){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:actinometer"} the sensitivity of this actinometer (column
to the right) is constant throughout most of the UV range, which makes
it very convenient for our work.

The amount of Fe(II) formed can be measured spectrophotometrically after
the addition of phenanthroline, which gives a strongly absorbing yellow
complex with Fe(II) ions.

The ferrioxalate (actually potassium ferrioxalate) for the actinometer
is prepared by mixing 3 volumes of 1.5 M potassium oxalate (COOK$_{2}$)
with 1 volume of 1.5 M FeCl$_3$ and stirring vigorously. This step and
all the following procedures involving ferrioxalate should be carried
out under red light (red fluorescent tubes or LEDs). The precipitated
should be dissolved in a minimal amount of hot water and the solution
allowed to cool for crystallization (this crystallization should be
repeated twice more). Potassium ferrioxalate can also be purchased
ready-made, but the price difference encourages self-fabrication. The
following is a recipe for the three solutions required to carry out
actinometry [see @Goldstein2008 for a different procedure and other
quantum yields]:

**Solution A:** Dissolve 2.947 g of the purified and dried K$_3$Fe(III)
oxalate in 800 ml distilled water, add 100 ml 0.5 M sulfuric acid, and
dilute the solution to 1000 ml. This gives 0.006 M actinometer solution,
which is suitable for measurement of ultraviolet radiation.

**Solution B:** The phenanthroline solution to be used for developing
the colour with Fe(II) ions should be 0.1% w/v 1:10 phenanthroline
monohydrate in distilled water.

**Solution C:** Prepare an acetate buffer by mixing 600 ml of 0.5 M
sodium acetate with 360 ml of 0.5 M H$_2$SO$_4$.

Solution A is irradiated with the radiation to be measured. The
geometries of both the container and of the radiation are important and
must be taken into account when evaluating the result. The simplest case
is when the radiation is [collimated]{acronym-label="collimated"
acronym-form="singular+short"}, the container a flat spectrophotometer
cuvette, the radiation strikes one face of the cuvette perpendicularly,
and no radiation is transmitted. Even in this case one has to
distinguish between whether the cuvette or the beam has the greater
cross section, and correct for reflection in the cuvette surfaces. The
irradiation time should be adjusted so that no more than 20% of the iron
is reduced (this corresponds to an
[absorbance]{acronym-label="absorbance" acronym-form="singular+short"}
of about 0.66). In the following we shall assume that we use an ordinary
fused-silica or quartz spectrophotometer cuvette with 10 mm inner
thickness and containing 3 ml actinometer solution.

After the irradiation and mixing of the actinometer solution, 2 ml of
the irradiated solution is mixed with 2 ml of solution B and 1 ml of
solution C, and then diluted to 20 ml with distilled water. After 30
minutes the absorbance at 510 nm is measured against a blank made up in
the same way with unirradiated solution A. An absorbance of 0.5
corresponds to 0.905 $\mymu$mol Fe$^{2+}$. It is a good idea to check
this relationship with known amounts of FeSO$_4$ if you have not
previously checked your spectrophotometer for accuracy and linearity.
You should not use any absorbance above 0.65.

Example of calculation: 3 ml of 0.006 M actinometer solution are
irradiated by parallel rays of 300 nm UV-B impinging at right angles to
one surface (and not able to enter any other surface). The radiation
cross section intercepted by the solution is 2 cm$^2$. Five minutes of
irradiation produces an absorbance of 0.6. This corresponds to
$0.6 \cdot 0.905/0.5$ $\mymu$mol = 1.086 $\mymu$mol Fe$^{2+}$, but since
we have taken 2 out of the 3 ml actinometer solution for analysis,
multiply by 3/2 to get the total amount of Fe$^{2+}$ formed. Throughout
the UV-B region the quantum yield is 1.26, so this corresponds to
absorption of $3 \cdot 1.086/2/1.26$ $\mymu$mol photons. Reflection from
the surface is estimated to be 7% (by application of Snell's law, or law
of refraction, giving the angle of refraction for an angle of incidence
at the boundary of two media like water and glass). None of the
radiation penetrates the solution to the rear surface, since the
solution thickness is 1 cm. Therefore the incident radiation is
$3 \cdot 1.086/(1.26 \cdot 0.93 \cdot 2)$ $\mymu$mol = 1.390 $\mymu$mol
radiation incident on 2 cm$^2$ in 5 minutes, and the photon irradiance
(quantum flux density, in this case equal to the photon fluence rate,
since the rays are parallel and at right angles to the surface) is
1.390/(2$\cdot$`<!-- -->`{=html}5) $\mymu$mol/cm$^2$/min = 0.1390
$\mymu$mol/cm$^2$/min = $10000 \cdot 0.1390/60$ $\mymu$mol/m$^2$/s =
23.2 $\mymu$mol/m$^2$/s.

@Kirk1983 point out errors that might arise if a more concentrated
actinometer solution is used, in order to absorb more light at long
wavelengths, and how these errors can be minimized. If an actinometer
much more concentrated than 0.006 M is used, the quantum yield is lower,
and we do not recommend this for UV research. @Goldstein2008, using
0.06 M actinometer solution, find almost the same quantum yield (1.24)
from 250 to 365 nm, but much higher (1.47) from 205 to 240 nm; the
latter in marked contrast to the values of @Fernandez1979 in the table
above, so measurements below 250 nm should be regarded with caution.
@Bowman1976 warn against exposure of the phenanthroline solution to UV,
and even against the fluorescent room lighting.

Chemical or biological systems (mostly in a solid state) for recording
solar radiation and particularly radiation, are widely employed for
estimating the exposure of people, leaves in a plant canopy, and other
objects which for various reasons are not easily amenable to
measurements with electronic devices. These chemical devices are
generally referred to as dosimeters rather than actinometers, even if
there is no defined delimitation between these categories. As the
construction, calibration, and use of chemical and other dosimeters have
been the subject of frequent reviewing
[@Berces1999; @Horneck1996; @Marijnissen1987], we shall not dwell on
them here, only stress that their radiation sensitive components can be
either chemical substances (natural such as DNA or provitamin D, or
artificial) or living cells (e.g., various spores and bacteria).

## Dosimeters

Broadband dosimeters have been developed to quantify exposure to UV
radiation based either upon the photochemical degradation of chemical
compounds and plastic films or using biological techniques involving
damage to DNA. The range of experimental methods has been described by
@Dunne1999 and @Parisi2010a. The most practical and effective dosimeters
for plant studies include the use of plastic films of polysulphone (PS)
and poly 2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide (polyphenylene oxide or PPO)
[see @Geiss2003; @Parisi2010b] and the determination of spore viability
after UV exposure [see e.g.
@Quintern1992; @Quintern1994; @Quintern1997; @Furusawa1998].

A commercially available UV-dosimetry system '*Viospor*' (Biosense,
Germany) uses the DNA molecules of microbial spores immobilised in a
film mounted in a protective casing with a cosine corrected filter
system to provide a measurement of biologically-weighted UV exposure
(Figure
[\[fig:UV:dosimeters:VS\]](#fig:UV:dosimeters:VS){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:UV:dosimeters:VS"}). *Viospor* sensors are available as
two types: *Viospor* blue-line types I-IV which provide estimates of the
CIE erythemal exposure (as MED, J m-2, and SED) at a range of exposure
levels from seconds to several days, and *Viospor* red-line which use
the DNA damage action spectrum [@Setlow1974] to estimate the DNA
damaging capacity of UV-B and UV-C radiation and the efficiency of UV-C
germicidal lamps. After exposure, films are incubated in bacterial
growth medium to stimulate spore germination and the production of
proteins that are stained for densitometric quantification. Exposed
dosimeters are returned to the supplier for analysis (***BioSense***,

:::

Small dosimeters have also been constructed from 30--45 film of the
thermoplastic polysulphone and can be used to determine exposure by
measuring the increase in [absorbance]{acronym-label="absorbance"
acronym-form="singular+short"} at 330 nm [@Geiss2003; @Parisi2010a]
ideally using an integrating sphere to minimise the effects of
scattering (Figure
[\[fig:UV:dosimeters:PS\]](#fig:UV:dosimeters:PS){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:UV:dosimeters:PS"}). Dosimeters can be calibrated in
sunlight by comparison with erythemally-calibrated broadband radiometers
or against lamp sources using a double monochromator spectroradiometer.
Ideally, the calibration should be determined under field conditions
appropriate for plant studies and if calibrated outside in sunlight the
calibration is only accurate under the prevailing atmospheric ozone
column as this modifies the UV spectrum. An erythemal dose can be
calculated from 40 polysulphone film using a relationship of the form
[see @Geiss2003]:

$$\mathrm{Radiation\ amount}\ (\Unit{J\,m^{-2}})  = 8025\, (\Delta \mathrm{A}_{330})^2 + 1980.8\, \Delta \mathrm{A}_{330}$$

where is the absorbance at 330 nm before exposure (which should be
between 0.105 and 0.133) minus the absorbance at 330 nm after exposure
plus a further 24 h in the dark. The film may also be calibrated against
other action spectra.

Accuracy of polysulphone dosimetry has been reported to be
$\pm$`<!-- -->`{=html}10% if is $<$`<!-- -->`{=html}0.3 but decreases to
$\pm$`<!-- -->`{=html}30% for up to 0.4 [@Diffey1987]. Greater
variability in occurs with increasing duration of exposure and
dosimeters saturate at sub-tropical sites in less than one day. However,
they have also been modified with a filter to provide an extended
dynamic range of exposure (over 3 to 6 days) without the need to replace
the dosimeter due to saturation [@Parisi2004a]. Polysulphone dosimeters
have been combined with a PAR dosimeter to investigate the visible and
UV radiation environment of plants [@Parisi1998; @Parisi2003] and
miniature versions have also been developed:
$1.5~\Unit{cm} \times 1.0~\Unit{cm}$ with an exposure of a 6 mm disc of
polysulphone [@Parisi2010a].

::: figure*
![image](photos/Polysulphone1.pdf){width="0.4\\myfigwidth"} ![image](photos/Polysulphone2.pdf){width="0.4\\myfigwidth"}
:::

For longer exposure periods, dosimeters using an alternative plastic
film, PPO, have been found more suitable as they saturate at
sub-tropical locations after 5--10 days. The change in absorbance of PPO
is quantified at 320 nm and it has been successfully calibrated to
erythemal exposures [@Lester2003] and by using a mylar (polyester)
filter for estimation of UV-A exposures [@Turnbull2008]. Both PS and PPO
dosimeters have been investigated for underwater use where PPO has been
considered viable when calibrated under water (but not using a
calibration in air) and under the relevant ozone column conditions of
the study [@Schouten2007; @Schouten2008]. The duration of use of PPO
dosimeters in air at sub-tropical locations has been extended from 5 to
10 days by the use of neutral density filters
[@Parisi2010b; @Schouten2010].

The use of properly calibrated UV dosimeters can be particularly
valuable in plant studies when long-term use of spectroradiometers and
broadband radiometers is restricted by availability of electrical
supplies or by physical constraints.

## Thermopiles

Most thermopiles have a flat response to (energy) irradiance across a
wide range wavelengths. They are arrays of thermocouples formed between
two different metal alloys. In a thermopile some couples are painted
white and some black (or some other arrangement is used to generate a
temperature difference dependent on absorbed energy), and the difference
in temperature induced by the absorption of radiation by the black
regions generates an electrical signal. A single thermocouple produces a
very small signal, but connecting them in series generates a large
signal that is easier to measure. Thermopiles can be either small for
use in the laboratory or larger, and protected by a quartz dome for use
in the field. Thermopile pyranometers are used to measure solar
radiation in the range 285 to 2800 nm. Examples of such instruments are
the pyranometers in the CMP series from Kipp & Zonen. Thermopile
pyranometers are standard instruments in weather stations. Thermopiles
can be also used to measure the (energy) irradiance of monochromatic
radiation, including radiation, if the dome or 'window' is made from an
transparent material.

## Broadband instruments

Broadband radiometers are instruments used to measure irradiance over a
broad region of the solar (or lamp) spectrum, weighted with an
instrument spectral response. A broadband radiometer consists of a
sensor that is designed to measure the solar radiation flux density ()
from a field of view of $2\pi$ steradians (180, or $\pi$ radians, when
projected on a perpendicular plane). The plane of the sensor is usually
positioned horizontally, but it can also be located, for example,
parallel to the surface of a leaf.

UV broadband radiometers integrate over either the UV-A or UV-B band or
both, which encompasses the entire UV region of daylight. The names
broadband and narrowband refer to the width of the 'window' or range of
wavelengths to which a sensor responds. The term full-width half-maximum
(FWHM) is used to measure this, it means the width of the peak in units
of wavelength, measured at half the maximum height of the peak along the
$y$-axis (with the output of the sensor on the $y$-axis plotted on a
linear scale). A narrow band-pass can have a 10 nm or 20 nm FWHM while a
wide one can have an 80 nm FWHM for instruments measuring a combination
of UV-A and UV-B radiation.

Their low cost, fast response (typically milliseconds to seconds),
stability and low maintenance requirements make them suitable for
continuous monitoring applications. The most common spectral response is
one that follows the erythemal action spectrum defined by the Commission
Internationale de l'Eclairage, or CIE, [@McKinlay1987; @Webb2011], which
describes the response of the human skin to UV radiation (Figure
[\[fig:action:spectra\]](#fig:action:spectra){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:action:spectra"}, on page ).

However, erythemally effective can be derived from most UV measuring
instruments if the radiation spectrum is known and fairly stable in time
such as when measuring sunlight. Hence, in meteorology the UV index is
taken as a common factor that should be obtained from the data at every
measuring site. Vice versa, using a correction factor to the
instrument's output, actual erythemal irradiance in effective can be
calculated. Data from UV broadband instruments are part of a worldwide
UV database that is located in the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation
Data Centre (WOUDC) as a part the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW)
programme of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).

As the spectral response of broadband radiometers only approximately
follow the needed for the desired response, their use for measuring
different radiation sources requires source-specific calibration. The
readings of broadband radiometers calibrated for sunlight should not be
used to assess doses from lamps without using correction factors
obtained by calibration. For measuring lamps and LEDs the use of a
spectroradiometer is strongly recommended.

### Principle of operation {#sec:broadband:principles:operation}

The basic design of broadband instruments has not changed significantly
since the introduction of the first erythemally weighted solar
radiometer, the Robertson-Berger meter [@Robertson1972; @Berger1976].
When direct and scattered solar radiation is transmitted through the
transmitting quartz dome, the most common way to obtain an erythemal
weighting is to filter out nearly all visible light using -transmitting
black-glass blocking filters. The remaining radiation then strikes a
sensitive fluorescent phosphor to convert UV-B light to visible light,
i.e. green light emitted by the phosphor. This light is filtered again
using coloured glass to remove any non-green visible light before
impinging on a gallium arsenic or a gallium arsenic phosphorus
photodiode used as detector.

::: figure*
![image](figures/Yankee_Pedro.pdf){width="0.55\\myfigwidth"}
:::

A thermally stable amplifier converts the diode's output current to a
voltage. It drives a line amplifier that provides a low impedance 0 to
+4 V DC output signal. Phosphor efficiency decreases by approximately
0.5% K$^{-1}$ and its wavelength response curve is shifted by
approximately 1 nm towards the red every 10 K. This latter effect is
particularly important because of the slope of the solar radiation curve
at these wavelengths. The glass filters, phosphor and photodiode are
held at 25 to 50, depending on the manufacturer, to ensure that the
output signal is not sensitive to changes in ambient temperature.
Temperature stabilization is usually achieved by an internal thermistor
that permits independent monitoring of the sensor's temperature (Figure
[\[fig:Yankee\]](#fig:Yankee){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Yankee"}). The analogue electrical signal produced by the
broadband UV instrument is converted into digital format for electronic
logging. The sampling frequency is usually between once per second (1
Hz) and once per minute. If the complete data set is not stored then
data are saved as averages over periods ranging from 10 minutes to not
more than one hour. Sometimes, the variation around the mean is also
recorded for each averaging period. This indicates the constancy of the
conditions during the averaging period (e.g. sun screening by rapidly
changing cloud cover: broken clouds or clear sky or constant
cloudiness). The raw signal must be converted into units of erythemal
irradiance () using a calibration factor, plus several corrections.
These corrections require additional data: solar zenith angle () and
ozone column depth at the time of measurement.

Erythemal effective irradiance () is calculated [@Webb2006]:
$$\irr[CIE] = (\voltage - \voltage[d]) \cdot k \cdot f(\SZA, \TOthree) \cdot f(\temperature) \cdot \Coscor$$
Where: $\voltage$ is the measured electrical signal from the radiometer,
$\voltage[d]$ is the electrical offset for dark conditions, $k$ is the
calibration coefficient, a constant value determined for specific
conditions, e.g. at of 40and a total ozone column of 300 DU[^20].
$f(\SZA, \TOthree)$ is a function of the solar zenith angle () and the
total column of ozone (), i.e. the function can be expressed as a
calibration matrix (or look up table) and is derived as part of the
calibration procedure. It is normalized at a solar zenith angle of 40and
a total ozone column of 300 DU. For solar zenith angles less than 40,
$f(\SZA, \TOthree)$ is often nearly unity. $f(\temperature)$ is the
temperature correction function. It is recommended that the instrument
is temperature stabilized. If this is not applicable then a correction
should be applied, which is complex and not always successful. $\Coscor$
is the cosine correction function (if necessary, otherwise =1).

The quality of the broadband instrument depends on the quality of the
protective quartz dome, the cosine response, the temperature stability,
and the ability of the manufacturer to match the erythemal curve with a
combination of glass and diode characteristics. Instrument temperature
stability is crucial, with respect to both the electronics and the
response of the phosphor to the incident UV radiation.

More recently, broadband instruments are using thin film metal
interference filter technology and specially developed silicon
photodiodes to measure UV erythemal irradiance. This overcomes many
problems connected with the phosphor technology, but on the other hand
they have difficulties related to very low photodiode signal levels and
filter stability. Silicon carbide () photodiodes have good sensitivity
to radiation and are intrinsically blind to visible radiation.

Other broadband instruments use one of these measurement technologies to
measure other regions of the spectrum by using either a combination of
glass filters or interference filters. Some manufacturers of these
instruments provide simple algorithms to approximate erythemal dosage
from the unweighted measurements [@WMO2008].

The maintenance of broadband instruments consists of ensuring that the
domes are cleaned, the instrument is level, the desiccant (if provided)
is active, and the heating/cooling system is working correctly, if so
equipped.

### Some commonly used terrestrial instruments {#sec:broadband:instruments}

The most common outdoor broadband radiometers are: SL 501 from Solar
Light, Inc. (Glenside, PA, USA), YES UVB-1 from Yankee Environmental
Systems, Inc. (Turners Falls, MA, USA), UVS-E-T (erythemal), UVS-A-T
(UV-A) and UVS-B-T (UV-B) from Kipp & Zonen (Delft, The Netherlands)
(Figure
[\[fig:UV:pyranometers\]](#fig:UV:pyranometers){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:UV:pyranometers"}). The principle of operation of these
meters is basically the same as described in section
[9.5.1](#sec:broadband:principles:operation){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:broadband:principles:operation"}. Unlike the other
meters, the Scintec UV-S-290-T uses a Teflon diffuser under the quartz
dome in front of the filters. These three instruments are temperature
stabilized by means of heating elements and temperature sensors. Solar
light also sells non-stabilized instruments like the PMA2101 (digital)
and PMA1101 (analog), which contain a temperature sensor whose output
can be used to correct in silico for the temperature dependency of the
UV-B readings.

:::

Broadband sensors based on special silicon photodiodes are also
available, which, are more stable with respect to variation in
temperature than those based on phosphors. Delta-Ohm (Padova, Italy),
Delta-T Devices (Cambridge, UK) and Sky instruments (Llandrindod Wells,
UK) make sensors based on this principle. Examples are the SKU 420, SKU
430, and SKU 440 (UV-A, UV-B, and erythemal, respectively) from Sky
Instruments, LP UVA 01/03 and LP UVB 01/03 from Delta-Ohm, and UV3pB-05
and UV3pA-05 from Delta-T devices (Figure
[\[fig:UV:diode:sensors\]](#fig:UV:diode:sensors){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:UV:diode:sensors"}). All of them are UV radiometers with
no temperature stabilization or in-built temperature sensors.
International Light Technologies (Peabody, USA) makes a wide array of
meters and sensors for measuring radiation. Vital Technologies used to
make good UV sensors which were popular some years ago, but the company
is no longer in business. Most of these sensors have built-in
preamplifiers.

### Spectral and angular (cosine) response

Radiation incident on a flat horizontal surface originating from a point
source with a defined zenith position will have an intensity value
proportional to the cosine of the zenith angle of incidence. This is
called the 'cosine law' or 'cosine-response' (see section
[9.1.2](#sec:basic:concepts:direction){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:basic:concepts:direction"} on page ). Ideally, a
pyranometer has a directional response, which is the same as the
cosine-law. Nevertheless, directional response in a pyranometer is
influenced by the quality, dimensions and construction of the (quartz)
dome and/or Teflon diffuser. Pyranometer cosine-response is defined in
their manufacturers specification as deviation from the ideal
cosine-response using the incidence angle up to 80with respect to
1000 irradiance at normal incidence (0). Most sensors deviate
considerably from ideal cosine response at angles between 80and 90.

The erythemal response of human skin to UV radiation varies with the
individual, but for the global evaluation of UV-related health effects
to succeed, broadband measurements have to be standardized, which means
that the radiometric characteristics of all meters should be identical.
The spectral response of every meter should follow exactly the same
reference action spectrum and the angular response should not deviate
from the cosine response [@Leszczynski2002]. Hence, the spectral
response of an ideal erythemally weighted radiometer should follow the
CIE curve, and the angular response should follow the cosine function.
Unfortunately, the angular and spectral response of real erythema meters
are far from ideal; moreover, the characteristics vary from one meter
unit to another, even within the same meter type [@Leszczynski2002].

Broadband radiometers that do not follow the CIE erythemal action
spectrum as are also used. For some radiometers the spectral response
follows a bell-shaped curve centred on the UV-A or UV-B bands (see
Figure
[\[fig:UV:sensors:spectra\]](#fig:UV:sensors:spectra){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:UV:sensors:spectra"}). Radiometers following the GEN or
other spectra commonly used as BSWFs in research with plants, are very
seldom used, and they are currently not available commercially. However,
almost any UV-B radiometer can be calibrated to measure according to
these BSWFs, but such calibrations are valid only when the calibration
light source exactly matches the spectrum of the measured light source.

::: figure*
![image](figures/fig_Kipp_spectra.pdf){width="0.8\\myfigwidth"} 
:::

### Calibration and intercomparison {#sec:broadband:calibration}

Each broadband instrument used to measure solar or lamp radiation should
be characterized for its spectral and angular response, and its
sensitivity to temperature (and if possible humidity). These
characteristics should be checked at regular intervals to determine
their stability. Also, correction is necessary for each instrument, as
no instrument has a spectral sensitivity identical to the erythemal
action spectrum.

To calibrate a broadband instrument for solar radiation, the basic
procedure is to simultaneously measure the spectral irradiance of the
sun with a calibrated spectroradiometer and the broadband meter under
cloudless sky conditions. The measured spectrum is weighted with the
desired spectral sensitivity[^21] of the broadband meter and integrated
over all wavelengths relevant for the broadband meter. The result is
given in the units \[detector-weighted \], relative to a defined
wavelength, usually the maximum of the erythemal action spectrum (CIE)
at 298 nm or the maximum of the spectral sensitivity of the broadband
meter. For different atmospheric conditions, such as different solar
elevation or different thickness of the ozone column, the relationship
between the detector-weighted spectral integral, measured with a
spectroradiometer, and the output of the broadband detector, after
cosine correction, should be constant within the uncertainty estimate;
if this is not the case, the mismatch indicates that the spectral
sensitivity of the broadband meter deviates from the that used to
calculate effective irradiances from the spectral irradiance data
(e.g. that defined by the CIE standard for erythema), or that the
spectroradiometric measurements were incorrectly done [@Seckmeyer2005].

When measuring the output from lamps using broadband sensors calibrated
under sunlight, large errors are incurred. In the example shown in Table
[\[tab:broadband:cal:errors\]](#tab:broadband:cal:errors){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:broadband:cal:errors"}, we use Kipp sensors because this
manufacturer has published instrument spectral response data plotted on
a logarithmic scale. Errors of a similar magnitude should be expected
for equivalent sensors from other manufacturers. When measuring the
irradiance from lamps under a background of sunlight as in some
modulated systems, or when the spectrum changes as occurs when profiling
the radiation change with depth in water bodies, other types of
instruments like multiband sensors or spectroradiometers are preferable.

### UV radiation monitoring in growth chambers, greenhouses and phytotrons

Erythemal broadband instruments are widely used to monitor UV radiation
levels in growth chambers. Great care must be taken when using such
instruments for this purpose since plant action spectra generally
deviate from the CIE function. In addition, the reflectance of walls and
other surfaces of growth chambers may affect the readings if the cosine
response is not good. Great care is needed when artificial light sources
are used, because their spectra differ greatly from the solar spectrum
for which broadband instruments are normally calibrated. Correction
factors for the solar zenith angle and ozone dependence of the
calibration factors are based on unfiltered solar spectra, so cannot be
applied to measurements performed in such chambers, hence special
treatment of data may be necessary. In most cases if absolute readings
are needed, the broadband sensor should be calibrated against a
double-monochromator spectroradiometer, for each different light source
to be measured. Failing to do so can cause huge errors in the
measurements of doses as shown in Table
[\[tab:broadband:cal:errors\]](#tab:broadband:cal:errors){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:broadband:cal:errors"}.

## Multi-channel filter instruments {#sec:multichannel}

Multichannel instruments are radiometers that measure a series of fixed,
usually narrow, wavelength bands of radiation. They are more rugged and
cheaper than high quality spectroradiometers and easier to deploy. Each
channel has its own detector (e.g. silicon photodiode) and filter
(e.g. interference filters). Usually there is a single diffuser acting
as common light collector for all channels. One example of a
multichannel instrument is the GUV-2511 from Biospherical Instruments
Inc (San Diego, USA) designed to measure cosine-corrected downwelling
irradiance at 305, 313, 320, 340, 380, and 395 nm, as well as PAR
(400--700 nm). When measuring daylight this allows to monitor UV
radiation in key UV wavebands for biological exposure studies. These
wavelengths also allow the extraction of cloud optical thickness and
total column ozone, two critical variables used in modelling the solar
spectrum. Multichannel sensors are mainly used for long-term monitoring
of irradiance and its geographic variation. They are also used for
ground measurements used to calibrate space-borne instruments carried by
satellites.

Recent multichannel instruments from Biospherical Instruments are
modular. They are composed of microradiometers of small size, one for
each channel, which together with input optics and filters are used to
build the multichannel instruments. Figure

The ELDONET terrestrial dosimeter consists of three broad band sensors,
measuring , and irradiance (Figure
[\[fig:ELDONET:terrestrial\]](#fig:ELDONET:terrestrial){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:ELDONET:terrestrial"}). It uses an integrating sphere to
collect the light, which reaches the detectors after bouncing on the
sphere walls. The autonomous version includes a built-in datalogger. It
is waterproof, but it is not submersible. The underwater version is
described in section
[9.8.3](#sec:underwater:radiometers){reference-type="ref"

## Spectroradiometers {#sec:spectroradiometers}

Spectroradiometers[^22] are instruments used to measure spectral
irradiance. There are two types of spectroradiometer: 1) scanning
spectroradiometers, and 2) array detector spectroradiometers. The former
have a single sensor, which is used to sequentially measure the spectral
irradiance at each wavelength, while the latter have an array of sensors
onto which the refracted spectrum is projected and measured
simultaneously at all wavelengths. Sometimes the more general term
spectrometer is adopted to indicate that the same instrument can be also
used to measure spectral absorbance, -transmittance, or -reflectance, in
addition to spectral irradiance. Scanning spectroradiometers scan a
range of wavelengths. To do this they require mechanically moving parts
inside the optic path and therefore need very stable housing for the
instrument. For this reason, scanning spectroradiometers are larger and
more difficult to transport than array detector spectroradiometers. They
are also less rugged and usually require mains power. However, in
scanning spectroradiometers it is possible to use a double monochromator
arrangement that makes their optical performance far superior to that of
array spectroradiometers which always use a single monochromator.

### Scanning spectroradiometers

#### Basic structure and principles of operation

The basic components of a scanning spectroradiometer are the following:
a) input optics for collecting radiation from the sky and guiding it
further into the spectroradiometer b) a monochromator for resolving the
input radiation into separate wavelengths c) a photomultiplier tube
(PMT) for detecting the energy possessed by each spectral component in
the measured spectrum. In addition, an external computer for
communication with the microprocessor of the spectroradiometer and for
collection, processing and storage of data is needed.

The input optics typically consists of a flat teflon diffuser covered by
a quartz dome. The diffuser collects the incident photons from the
overhead hemisphere. The resulting diffuse radiation is guided to the
entrance slit of the monochromator, sometimes by means of an optical
fibre. The monochromator may be a single or a double monochromator (see
section [8.2.4](#sec:spectrographs){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:spectrographs"} on page ). In scanning
spectroradiometers, a system based on a step motor drives a mask that
allows only photons of a certain wavelength at a time to enter the exit
slit of the monochromator. The exit slit serves as the entrance window
to the cathode of the PMT. The photon pulses are amplified and
transmitted to a photon counter for registration.

Some spectroradiometers are constructed on a solar tracker that follows
the position of the sun. This eliminates the effects of potential
azimuthal dependencies in the detection of radiation. A measurement head
at the end of an optical fibre may be also installed on a separate sun
tracker. The temperature of the instrument is usually either stabilized
or kept above a certain temperature limit to ensure proper functioning.
The dome of the measurement head may be equipped with a heater and/or
air blower to keep the temperature of the teflon within certain limits
and to avoid emergence of frost onto the dome.

Other spectroradiometers are less rugged and are intended for laboratory
or spot measurements outdoors. They are more portable but more sensitive
to temperature extremes and are not water proof. Examples of such
instruments are Optronics OL 756 and Macam SR9910 spectroradiometers.
Figure
[\[fig:Optronics:OL_756\]](#fig:Optronics:OL_756){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Optronics:OL_756"} shows the different parts of the first
of these instruments.

The more rugged instruments, usually permanently installed at a fixed
location, are commonly used for measuring long (several years long) time
series of spectral irradiance data. The more portable instruments are
used for spot measurements in plant canopies, and under lamps, and or
filters. The first type of instrument is most commonly used by
meteorologists, while the portable instruments are most useful to
biologists.

#### Characteristics

**Dark current** and **dead time** are characteristics possessed by the
PMT. Dark current is a measure of the drift photons going from the
cathode to the anode of the PMT without any real incident photons
entering the instrument. Dead time is a measure of that PMT which is in
a paralysed state after a photon detection event. Stray light is
composed of photons echoed from wavelengths other than the nominal
wavelength being measured. In commercially available scanning
spectroradiometers, these phenomena are usually measured and handled by
the measurement software.

The **wavelength alignment** of a spectroradiometer has to be checked
regularly. Most instruments taking daily measurements contain an
internal mercury lamp aimed at ensuring the stability of the alignment.
The wavelength and the position of the micrometer turning the grating of
the monochromator are related to each other by a second-order equation
using so called dispersion coefficients. The determination of the
dispersion coefficients should be part of the annual maintenance of the
instruments.

Solar irradiance spectra sometimes exhibit so called **noise spikes**,
which mean sudden abnormally high or low intensity readings on a single
wavelength. The origin of the spikes is not fully resolved, but
straylight is considered a partial explanation. The spikes can be
detected and eliminated making use of suitable reference spectra.

Ideally, the angular response of the measurement head follows the shape
of a cosine curve. In practice, the response deviates somewhat from
this. Typically, the larger the solar zenith angle, the larger the
deviation. The **cosine response** of the measurement head should be
measured in laboratory and a corresponding correction applied to all
measured data.

If the spectroradiometer is not stabilized for temperature, its response
usually exhibits **temperature dependence**. This dependence should be
determined in the laboratory by measuring a calibration lamp with a
spectroradiometer heated/cooled over a range of different wavelengths.
The measurements can be used for deriving the temperature correction
factors to be applied in the post-processing of the sky measurements.

The **slit function** determines the transmittance of a monochromator as
a function wavelength. The ideal shape of the function would be
triangular. The full width at half maximum of the slit function is
commonly used as a quantity characterizing the slit function. The slit
function can be derived by measuring the irradiance emitted by a tunable
laser. Removal of the effect of the slit function on the measured
spectra should be considered if spectra measured by two or several
instruments are to be compared with each other.

The **spectral responsivity** of a spectroradiometer should be based on
regular measurements of a certified calibration lamp. If the
responsivity seems to have changed, basically two alternative ways to
handle the change exist. The change may be introduced in the
responsivity of the instrument and the processing of the sky
measurements as such. A step-wise change in response is hence introduced
in the time series of the measurements. Alternatively, a gradually
changing response time-series may be defined using a moving average with
a suitable time window. In this way, the change in the response is
introduced gradually in the time series of the sky irradiance
measurements.

#### Maintenance

The maintenance of a scanning spectroradiometer operating in an outdoor
environment involves the following practices: a) general daily
maintenance; b) checks on the wavelength setting and stability of
irradiance scale; c) calibration of irradiance against primary standards
in a dark room.

Daily routine maintenance includes cleaning of the quartz dome and
checking on the general functioning as well as the correct levelling of
the instrument. The quartz dome should also be cleaned/dried after rain
or snow. The operator should be familiar with the control software of
the instrument. Additional simple routines based on, for instance,
selected reference spectra may be used for instant checking of the
measured data. These kinds of routines are invaluable in the prompt
detection of occasional malfunctions of the instrument.

An internal Hg lamp is used for checking of the wavelength scale in some
spectroradiometers. In these cases, it is convenient to imbed the Hg
lamp measurement into the daily measurement schedule. If the instrument
lacks an internal lamp, this check has to be done using an external
lamp. For checking the stability of the irradiance scale, portable
calibration units are available. These enable, for instance, stability
checks of the instrument at the measuring site on a weekly basis. It is
advisable that the humidity indicators are also checked on a weekly
basis.

Irradiance calibration of a spectroradiometer should be performed in a
dark room (Figure
[\[fig:Brewer:calibration\]](#fig:Brewer:calibration){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Brewer:calibration"}). A primary standard lamp with an
irradiance certificate provided by a certified laboratory of standards
is needed. To extend the lifetime of the primary standard lamp, it is
recommended that it is not used as a regular calibration lamp. Instead,
the irradiance scale of the primary lamp should be transferred to a
secondary standard lamp that is used as a working calibration lamp. Use
of several working lamps is recommended to enable recognition of
potential drifts in the radiant output of the lamps as they age.
Calibration against the primary/secondary standard lamp should be
performed at least every two months. The desiccant bags inside the cover
of the spectrometer should be taken out and dried at least every two
months as well. Proper levelling of the instrument has to be ensured
after having it relocated for outdoor measurements.

On the annual maintenance practices of a spectroradiometer, each
manufacturer has its own services and recommendations. Participation in
intercomparison campaigns gathering a number of state-of-the-art
instruments to conduct measurements on a jointly agreed schedule for a
period of time has proven a fruitful way to investigate the long-term
stabilities and overall performances of scanning spectroradiometers
(Figure
[\[fig:Brewer:intercomparison\]](#fig:Brewer:intercomparison){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Brewer:intercomparison"}).

### Array detector spectroradiometers

In contrast to scanning spectroradiometers, array detector instruments
measure spectral irradiance simultaneously at all wavelengths. The
detector in this case is a linear array of light sensors, similar in
structure to the imaging sensors used in digital cameras, but long and
narrow. The number of detector elements ('pixels') along the array
varies, 2000 to 3000 pixels being common[^23]. The array can be a
'charge coupled device' (CCD), or an array of photodiodes (DAD). The
'image' of the spectrum produced by the monochromator is projected and
focused by means of mirrors onto the linear detector array, each
detector in the array receiving light of a certain wavelength. In the
case of array spectrometers it is not possible to use two monochromators
in tandem to reduce stray light. Array spectrometers are small and
portable (Figure
[\[fig:Maya2000Pro\]](#fig:Maya2000Pro){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Maya2000Pro"}).

![image](photos/Maya2000Pro.jpg)
![image](photos/Maya2000Pro-1.jpg)

For measuring energy or photon spectral irradiance a cosine diffuser is
used as input optics. This ensures that the angular response follows the
cosine law, and so the instrument measures the radiation as received on
a flat surface. Other input optics are also available, for example, with
a narrow angle of view. However, the quantity measured with them is not
irradiance. Cosine diffusers differ widely in how closely they follow
the cosine law. Some cheaper models are prone to large errors,
especially when radiation impinges at a sharp angle to their surface.
This will be further discussed in section
[9.7.2.1](#sec:array:errors){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:array:errors"} on page .

The input optics is usually connected to the array spectrometer with an
optical fibre. The type of fibre to be used depends on the wavelength
range to be measured. If smaller than the entrance of the
spectroradiometer, the diameter of the fibre will affect the amount of
radiation entering the instrument. The diameter also affects the
mechanical properties of the fibre: thin fibres are more flexible and
tolerate bending into curves of smaller diameter. Fibres also vary with
regards to the type of cladding material used to protect them. Fibres
with metal cladding tolerate rougher handling than those with plastic
cladding. The most common connector for these fibres and accessories is
the SMA 905, originally designed for light fibres used in digital
communication systems. For this reason their positioning upon repeated
attachment is not exactly the same. Consequently, the recommendation is
**not** to detach and reattach the fibre from the spectrometer without
recalibrating the system[^24].

At the entrance of the spectrometer, just behind the connector to which
the fibre is attached, there is a slit (Figure
[\[fig:CCD:slit\]](#fig:CCD:slit){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:CCD:slit"}), which limits the width and height of the
incoming light beam. The width is of the order of a few micrometres and
the exact value chosen determines, together with the monochromator, the
spectral resolution of the spectroradiometer. The narrower the slit, the
narrower the beam hitting the monochromator and the better the
resolution (the narrower the peaks that can be resolved). In a
Czerny-Turner configuration (Figure
[\[fig:optical:bench\]](#fig:optical:bench){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:optical:bench"}), the next component is a collimating
mirror which projects the beam onto a monochromator. Gratings are used
as monochromators. Gratings have a surface with very closely spaced
rulings of a specific profile, and they separate radiation of different
wavelengths in a similar way to a prism. One important parameter is the
density of rulings which is one of the determinants of spectral
resolution and useful wavelength range. The 'image' produced by the
grating is focused onto the array detector by another collimating
mirror. Some newer models of spectrometer from StellarNet
(e.g. BLACK-Comet spectrometer) and now also from Ocean Optics (Torus
spectrometer) use a concave grating instead of a planar one. Since the
grating itself focuses the light onto the array detector, collimating
mirrors are not needed. Having fewer optical components, an instrument
with better stray light performance is obtained.

:::

The array detector normally has rectangular 'pixels', orientated so that
their shorter dimension is on the axis along which the different
wavelengths have been separated by the monochromator, and their longer
dimension is perpendicular to it. The entrance slit is positioned to
have the long dimension coincident with the long dimension of the
pixels. In some detectors the long pixels are in reality rows of square
pixels with their electrical output combined into a single output
signal. The output signal from the pixels is averaged by the detector
itself over what is called 'integration time'. The longer the
integration used, the lower the irradiance that can be measured.
However, the 'dark noise' increases with the integration time. In
addition, it is possible to take several scans and average them. A
coarse dark noise correction is sometimes done by subtracting the signal
from special pixels at the end of the array that are not exposed to
radiation. However a dark scan, with the input optics protected from the
incoming radiation, should also be measured, and its value, wavelength
by wavelength subtracted from the measurements. The dark noise depends
on temperature. This has two implications, dark scans should be taken
frequently, sometimes before or after each measurement, and the
spectrometer should be allowed to warm up for some minutes before
starting to take readings. Furthermore, when working outdoors it should
be protected from direct sunlight, so as to keep its temperature stable
and close to that at which it was calibrated. Some spectrometers have a
thermoelement (TE), working according to the Peltier principle, which
cools the array detector to a preset temperature and thereby stabilizes
it.

Most current array spectrometers, the exception being some models with
thermoelectrically cooled detectors, are powered through the USB port of
a personal computer. For portable use a laptop is frequently used.
Special software, sold by the manufacturer of the spectrometer, is used
to control the instrument and acquire and plot the spectra (Figure
[\[fig:SpectraSuite\]](#fig:SpectraSuite){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:SpectraSuite"}). For most instruments there are also
drivers and software development kits (SDK) available for developing
programs for special applications. When special corrections, for example
for stray light, are performed it may be necessary to acquire raw
spectral data and apply corrections and calibrations off-line using
other software, for example Excel or R.

#### Measuring errors and limitations in accuracy {#sec:array:errors}

Array spectroradiometers have a great advantage when quickly measuring
changing radiation as they acquire all wavelengths simultaneously. This
ensures that the values of spectral irradiance measured at all
wavelengths are consistent. In contrast, under conditions where
irradiance varies rapidly with time, the shape of the measured spectrum
can get badly distorted when measured with a scanning spectroradiometer.
However, array spectrometers have a serious limitation in that they
cannot be built with double monochromators. As any spectroradiometer
with a single monochromator, they suffer from relatively high values of
stray light. Stray light originates from scattered light of incorrect
wavelengths falling on a pixel of the array detector. In other words,
radiation of one wavelength is detected (and measured) as radiation of a
different wavelength. Perfectly scattered radiation would affect all
pixels in the same way, but when there are reflections within the
optical bench that are not perfectly scattered, some pixels in the array
detector are more affected by stray light than others. Stray light is a
critical specification when measuring UV-B in sunlight, as UV-B
irradiance is very low compared to the irradiance of visible and near
infra-red radiation. Consequently, if even a small proportion of visible
radiation is scattered and reflected as stray light within the
instrument, this stray light can generate a signal on the 'UV-B pixels'
of the array of a magnitude similar to, or larger than, that produced by
the radiation that we are trying to measure. Stray light is such a big
problem that without very complicated and special corrections these
instruments cannot be used at all to measure radiation in sunlight.
Errors of more than 100%[^25] for biologically effective doses can be
incurred even with a well calibrated instrument. Failure to take this
into account has led to important mistakes, like the erroneous
measurement of solar radiation at ground level by NASA researchers which
was published in *Geophysical Research Letters*. This was most likely an
artifact due to the limitations of the array spectrometer used. See the
paper by @DAntoni2007 and the refutation by @Flint2008 and the answer by
@DAntoni2008. Equally, the values of the UV-B doses used in many recent
biological experiments, as reported in the publications, are suspect,
since they have been based on measurements performed with
single-monochromator instruments.

Gratings disperse radiation according to what are called 'orders'. For
example first order dispersion may be 10 nm/mm, second order dispersion
5 nm/mm, third order dispersion 2.5 nm/mm, and so on. The first order
spectrum is what is of interest, and is what we want the array detector
to see. However, any given 'pixel' in the array, in addition to
radiation corresponding to the first order (e.g. 800 nm), also sees
radiation corresponding to higher orders (e.g. 400 nm, 266.6 nm, 200 nm,
and so on) if those wavelengths are present in the incoming radiation.
The solution to this problem is to use 'order-sorting filters' in the
light pass. In array spectrometers order-sorting filters may be directly
coated onto the array detector, or attached to it. For example Ocean
Optics spectrometers can be bought with a *variable longpass
order-sorting filter* as an option (Figure
[\[fig:CCD:slit\]](#fig:CCD:slit){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:CCD:slit"}).

Another problem with array detector spectrometers is that the radiation
may be better focused on some parts of the array than on others, and
this causes changes in spectral resolution with changing wavelengths. In
addition, the wavelength difference between adjacent pixels is not
always the same across the whole spectrum, neither is the step size an
integer number. Usually the software supplied with the instrument can
generate files with data at integer steps (e.g. 1 nm, or 5 nm) but this
is done by interpolating and averaging, rather than changing the
measurement itself. In contrast the scanning step of scanning
spectroradiometers can be controlled through its software.

The overall accuracy of the measurements is also reliant on the angular
response of the entrance optics. For measuring spectral irradiance we
generally use a cosine diffusor as entrance optics, although it is also
possible to use an integrating sphere. Deviations of cosine diffusers
from the theoretical angular response tend to increase at large angles
from the vertical. If the spectrum of the light coming from different
angles is different (e.g. sun and sky) not only the irradiance measured
may be inaccurate but also the shape of the spectrum may be distorted.
When measuring outdoors, the size of this error will change through a
day as the sun moves across the sky. The very small cosine diffusers
sold by the spectrometer manufacturers tend to be prone to large errors,
and individually calibrated, high quality diffusers like the D7-SMA and
D7-H-SMA from Bentham (see section
[9.20](#sec:quant:suppliers){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:quant:suppliers"} on page for full address) are
preferable, although they are much more expensive (Figure
[\[fig:Bentham:diffuser\]](#fig:Bentham:diffuser){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Bentham:diffuser"}).

#### Calibration and corrections {#sec:array:calibration}

When measuring UV-B with an array spectroradiometer it is not enough to
have it properly calibrated, its optical characteristics (slit function
at different wavelengths, stray light properties) need to be measured
and a correction algorithm developed and later applied to each
measurement. This makes the use of array spectroradiometers for
characterizing UV-B doses complicated and error prone. This type of use
has to be attempted only by experienced operators and the correction
algorithm itself requires lots of effort to develop and implement. Given
the lack of standardized procedures for stray light correction, its
implementation requires advanced knowledge of optics and metrology. We
will first discuss spectral calibration and thereafter stray light
correction procedures.

Spectral calibration against standard lamps needs to be repeated
regularly. For measurements not requiring very high precision, annual
re-calibrations may be enough. However, the main consideration should be
how valuable is the data that will be acquired. If the spectral
sensitivity of the instrument has changed significantly from one
calibration to the next, the data from all measurements done in between
these calibrations are suspect, and should be discarded. Consequently if
one does yearly re-calibrations one can lose one year's worth of data,
while if one does monthly re-calibrations one only risks losing one
month's worth of data. Consequently, the decision on how frequently to
calibrate should, in addition to instrument stability, be based on the
maximum size of the tolerable errors and on the value of the data
(i.e. the cost of replacing the data if they need to be discarded).

The most common and stable calibration light sources are incandescent
lamps (e.g. FEL lamps) with electronics in the power source which keeps
the electrical power at the filament constant within very narrow
margins. The distance between the lamp and the entrance optics, and
their alignment, should also fall within a very narrow margin of the
expected values. Calibration lamps are secondary or tertiary standards,
connected by a chain of calibration steps to a standard kept at a
metrology agency like NIST. Calibration lamps are supplied with spectral
data about their emission characteristics. Calibration of the instrument
is done by measuring the known spectrum and irradiance of the
calibration lamp. Of course the output of the lamp will not exactly
match the data supplied with it, because its original calibration is
also subject to errors. Furthermore, there are errors deriving from
slight differences between the burning conditions (current and voltage)
during measurements and those when it was calibrated at the factory.
Further errors can be introduced by small differences in the geometry of
the optical setup. So, do not forget that calibrations are subject to
errors. Furthermore, you cannot obtain an absolute estimate of
calibration errors by comparing two instruments calibrated with the same
lamp, unless this lamp is the primary standard.

Calibrating a spectroradiometer in the UV-B band with a FEL lamp is not
recommended, because FEL lamps emit very little UV-B. For calibration in
the UV-B deuterium lamps need to be used. Irradiance emitted by
deuterium lamps is less stable than that emitted by FEL lamps. For
coarse calibration the use of a deuterium lamp may be enough, but for
accurate calibration it is best to use FEL and deuterium lamps in
tandem. The shape of the spectrum emitted by deuterium lamps is stable,
by matching the irradiances at wavelengths where the emission of both
types of lamps overlap, one can extend an accurate calibration to
shorter wavelengths. Spectrometer manufacturers also sell calibration
light sources (lamp plus electronics) that may be good for routine
calibration or especially for checking that calibrations performed in an
optical bench remain valid. Again, what type of calibration procedure
and lamp to use will depend on the accuracy required. If we want our
measurements to be within $\pm 10$% of the true value we will need to
use very good equipment and protocols for the calibration. If we can
tolerate errors of, for example, $\pm 25$%, calibrations can be less
accurate.

It is also very important to do a wavelength calibration and to check
this calibration regularly. It should not be forgotten when doing this
calibration that it is affected by the temperature of the instrument as
temperature affects (by thermal expansion) the dimensions of the optical
bench and its components. Wavelength calibration is done based on
elemental emission lines in discharge lamps (or even the sun). For quick
checks low pressure mercury or germicidal lamps may be used. The
manufacturers of spectrometers also sell special light sources for
wavelength calibration. One should choose carefully which wavelengths to
use (for example 253.652 nm, 296.728 nm, 334.148 nm, and 404.657 nm for
mercury lamps, as they are simple peaks rather than multiple peaks very
close together like those at 302 nm, 313 nm and 365 nm). If one desires
a calibration accurate to a fraction of the wavelength step of the array
one needs to fit a bell-shaped curve to the pixel showing the highest
signal and those adjacent to it, to find the true location of the peak
centre, most likely in-between two pixels.

To keep errors within $\pm 10$% in the UV-B when measuring sunlight, and
especially to keep errors within $\pm 10$% for biologically effective
doses, a good calibration is not enough when using single monochromator
spectroradiometers. There is also a need to correct for stray light. If
we do not correct for stray light some biologically effective doses will
be overestimated by more than 100%. The ratio between stray light in the
UV-B band and the maximum spectral irradiance measured in good single
monochromator spectrometers is approximately 1$\times 10^{-3}$, while in
double monochromator spectroradiometers it can be as low as
$1 \times 10^{-6}$. If time for scanning, cost and lack of portability
are no obstacles, it's preferable to use double monochromator
instruments and these should also be used as the main instrument in a
laboratory.

When applying the stray light correction, a thorough characterization of
the slit function at different wavelengths and a check of the wavelength
dependence of stray light are needed. This characterization does not
need to be repeated, unless changes are made to the optical bench of the
instrument. So, in contrast to the spectral calibration, the stray light
characterization needs to be performed only once during the lifetime of
the instrument unless major repairs or modifications are made.

In some array spectrometers, depending on the configuration, the width
of the slit function may vary with the wavelength. This can introduce
errors that are very difficult to correct. In some cases it might be
preferable to chose a grating giving the instrument a relatively narrow
wavelength range, for example 250 nm to 500 nm if the intended use is to
measure irradiance.

The use and calibration of array spectroradiometers for measurement of
UV-B radiation in sunlight is discussed in detail in the WMO report by
@Seckmeyer2010. Stray light correction methods are discussed in the
papers by @Ylianttila2005, @Coleman2008, and @Kreuter2009 and the
references therein.

## Underwater sensors and profiling

### Measuring underwater UV radiation {#sec:underwater:measuring}

Measuring UV radiation in the aquatic environment is difficult.
Waterproof UV-measuring devices are needed or sensors protected in water
proof housings as well as a means of deploying the sensors at the
desired depth. Frequently, underwater measurements are referenced to the
(spectral) irradiance at the surface of the water body, measured
simultaneously with a matched "atmospheric" or terrestrial sensor.

As was mentioned in section [7.6](#sec:UV:aquatic){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:UV:aquatic"} on page , measurement of the underwater UV
field presents particular complexities, mainly related to variable
attenuation occurring in different water bodies [@Kirk1994]. Depending
on the physical and chemical characteristics of the water, irradiance
may decrease much more rapidly than irradiance (this phenomenon is known
as 'spectral leakage'), resulting in a changing spectrum with depth.
Thus, underwater UV instruments are normally equipped with different
filters and photodiodes to minimize these effects and to improve the
sensitivity to particular wavelengths of interest. As discussed above in
section [9.5.4](#sec:broadband:calibration){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:broadband:calibration"} on page , errors are introduced
if the spectrum being measured differs from that of the source used for
calibration of the broadband instrument. This implies that when using
broadband sensors underwater the errors will depend on the depth at
which the radiation is being measured. In addition, a general problem
exists for broadband sensors and spectrometers if sensors are only
calibrated in air. The same calibration function cannot be used with the
sensor in air and in water. Wavelength-dependent correction factors, so
called immersion factors, must be used to adjust the signal if sensors
are immersed in water as for example described by [@ohdet03].

Water movement and weather conditions can affect the measurements of
underwater UV radiation. For an accurate determination of UV radiation
in the field, sunny, cloudless conditions and calm waters are preferred.
The effect of waves may cause difficulties especially when measuring
near the surface. On the other hand, clouds and other atmospheric UV
absorbing phenomena can alter the conditions during the measurement of
vertical light profiles, especially when the diffuse component of the
beam is altered.

Solar zenith angle is an important factor which affects the irradiance
above the water surface, and also the reflectance of the water surface
for the wavelengths of biological relevance. In addition, the
[RAF]{acronym-label="RAF" acronym-form="singular+short"} (RAF, see also
section [\[sec:RAF\]](#sec:RAF){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:RAF"}), can be used to estimate the effect of changes in
the ozone column on biologically effective exposure. Corrections can be
applied to measurements performed with broadband instruments, but
measurements with narrow-band multi-filter instruments and
spectroradiometers are less error prone.

If our objective is to describe the characteristics of the waters,
radiation should be measured around solar noon, when solar elevation is
maximal. However, if we are interested in describing the daily exposure
of some organism, measurements should be done preferably during most of
the day and at the depths of interest.

### Profiling {#sec:underwater:profiling}

Profiling is the measurement of irradiance or spectral irradiance as a
function of depth in a water body. Special frames are used for lowering
the instruments through the water. For light measuring instruments, the
frame or rig should not occlude the field of view of the radiation
sensors. A means of determining the depth at which the sensor is
located, and any deviation from a vertical orientation should also be
available. Suitable cabling is used to connect the underwater sensors to
onboard computers or dataloggers.

### Underwater radiometers {#sec:underwater:radiometers}

Various underwater radiometers are currently available and their
accuracy and characteristics vary considerably. The most appropriate
instrument to choose depends on the specific goals of a study. Different
types of radiometers include broadband radiometers, narrow-band
multifilter radiometers, photodiode array spectroradiometers, and
scanning spectroradiometers, including single monochromator
spectroradiometers. Comparisons of the main characteristics of different
types of instruments have been published
[@Kirk1994; @Diaz2000; @Kjeldstad2003; @Tedetti2006]. Some commonly-used
underwater instruments are described below.

The **ELDONET radiometers** (Real Time Computer, Germany) were developed
within the framework of the European light dosimeter network (Figure
[\[fig:Eldonet\]](#fig:Eldonet){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Eldonet"}) and have been described in detail
[@Hader1999]. The dosimeters are three-channel broadband filter devices
with an entrance optic consisting of an integrating Ulbricht sphere with
an internal BaSO$_4$ coating [@Khanh1988]. Silicon photodiodes (BPX60
for the PAR range and SFH291 for the two UV wavebands, both from
Siemens, Germany) are used in combination with custom-made filters to
select the wavelength ranges for UV-B (280--315 nm), UV-A (315--400 nm)
and PAR (400--700 nm), a custom-made interference filter for UV-B (Janos

**Submergible multichannel radiometers** like PUV 500, PUV 2500 series
from Biospherical Instruments (San Diego, USA) are equipped with
narrow-band filter detectors in the range of UV and PAR (Figure
[\[fig:PUV\]](#fig:PUV){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:PUV"}).
These radiometers are equipped with depth and temperature sensors and
thus are well suited for accurate light profiling. The spectral
characteristics of the five filters used in the PUV 500 instrument are
as follows: 305$\pm$`<!-- -->`{=html}1 nm (band pass
7$\pm$`<!-- -->`{=html}1 nm) 320$\pm$`<!-- -->`{=html}2 nm (band pass
11$\pm$`<!-- -->`{=html}1 nm) 340$\pm$`<!-- -->`{=html}2 nm (band pass
10$\pm$`<!-- -->`{=html}1 nm) 380$\pm$`<!-- -->`{=html}2 nm (band pass
10$\pm$`<!-- -->`{=html}1 nm)

On the other hand, the PUV 2500 measures 7 (optionally 8) wavebands of
downwelling irradiance (305, 313, 320, 340, 380, 395 nm and PAR:
400--700 nm) with one upwelling radiance channel (natural fluorescence).
Each channel with 10 nm FWHHM except 305 (controlled by atmospheric
ozone cutoff). The instrument includes pressure/depth sensing (350 m
maximum) and temperature control. A 32 channel multiplexer selects
signals from 8 photodetectors, temperature, pressure and tilt/yaw
detector. The cosine collector is made of Teflon-covered quartz for use
in the water.

The RAMSES family of **hyperspectral radiometers** (Trios GmbH, Germany)
are miniature single monochromator spectrometers with a resolution of 2
to 3 nm per pixel and 100 or 190 usable channels in the photodiode array
(Figure [\[fig:RAMSES\]](#fig:RAMSES){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:RAMSES"}). They can be used in air or in water. The
Ramses ACC-UV is an integrated UV hyperspectral radiometer, and the
Ramses ACC-VIS is a and visible hyperspectral radiometer, both equipped
with a cosine collector. Ramses ASC-VIS is equipped with a spherical
collector shielded so as to measure radiation from one hemisphere. To
measure scalar irradiance, two of these sensors can be deployed pointing
in opposite directions. They are calibrated for underwater and air
measurements (two different calibrations). The device has a small size,
the signal capture requires some power consumption and portable (laptop)
terminal at the surface. The detector type is a silicon photodiode array
designed to capture wavelengths between 320--950 nm for VIS models and
280--500 nm for the UV models, with an irradiance accuracy better than
6--10% depending on the spectral range.

Although the LI-1800UW instrument is not currently produced by LI-COR,
many foundational studies focused on UV penetration during the 1980s and
1990s were carried out using this spectroradiometer. The optics of this
scanning spectroradiometer is based on a single holographic
monochromator grating, a silicon detector and a filter wheel to improve
stray light rejection. The wavelength range is between 300 and 850 nm,
with a bandwidth of 8 nm and accuracy of $\pm$`<!-- -->`{=html}1.5 nm.
Originally optional slits of different widths were available, so these
specifications vary with the exact configuration used. The whole optical
bench and the microcomputer system is contained in the massive
waterproof housing designed for measurements to a depth close to 200 m.
Being a single monochromator instruments its accuracy is limited by
stray light when used to measure -B radiation in daylight.

The OL 754-O-PMT Spectrometer Optics Head (Optronic Laboratories) is
based on a double monochromator for low stray light and measuring from
300 to 850 nm. Configurations with other gratings giving different
wavelength ranges are available. The system utilizes holographic
gratings with peak efficiencies at 300 nm. The instrument can be fitted
with an OL IS-470-WP Submersible Sphere Assembly (4-inch integrating
sphere) attached by means of quartz optical fibre to the non-submersible
spectroradiometer. The sphere follows a dual port design with an
entrance port and an exit port located 90$^\circ$ apart. The sphere
contains an internal baffle in front of the exit port to permit only
light reflected by internal surface of the sphere to exit the sphere and
enter the fibre.

Another approach to measuring underwater radiation is to protect a
regular sensor, as for example, those described in section
[9.5.2](#sec:broadband:instruments){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:broadband:instruments"} on page , within a hermetic
water-proof housing (Figure
[\[fig:sensor:in:box\]](#fig:sensor:in:box){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:sensor:in:box"}). Of course the enclosure should have an
transparent window, and the sensors must be calibrated inside the
enclosure.

## Modelling {#sec:modelling}

For locations and times not covered by measurements, alternative
approaches have to be considered for estimating the prevailing radiation
conditions. For this purpose, various methods for modelling the surface
UV radiation have been developed. These range from simple
theoretical-empirical methods for estimating the clear-sky surface
radiation to more sophisticated methods that account also for the
effects of clouds as inferred either from ground-based station data or
satellite measurements.
Table [\[tab:modelling:methods\]](#tab:modelling:methods){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:modelling:methods"} gives a simplified view of the main
features of methods that are available for modelling the surface UV
radiation.

[]{#methods label="methods"}
::::

Simple theoretical-empirical methods, such as those of @Bjorn1985 and
@bird1986, have been widely used thanks to their fairly simple user
interface. These methods provide spectral surface irradiances,
optionally on tilted surfaces, and account for the main parameters
affecting the surface radiation conditions under cloudless skies.
Results indicate that they predict the surface radiation with reasonable
accuracy as compared to more detailed radiative transfer calculations
and measurements [@bird1986].

Another user-friendly alternative is to use an interactive web-based
interface to radiative transfer simulations, such as the FastRT
[@engelsen2005 available at
<http://nadir.nilu.no/~olaeng/fastrt/fastrt.html>] or the QUICK TUV
(<http://cprm.acd.ucar.edu/Models/TUV/Interactive_TUV/>). Both of these
are based on rigourous radiative transfer models, which means that their
accuracy depends mainly on the choice of values for the input
parameters. Both include a selection of biological weighting functions,
and FastRT also provides the possibility to account for the effect of
clouds.

When cloud effects need to be accounted for in detail, either satellite
methods or so-called reconstruction methods should be considered. The
reconstruction methods usually rely on ground-based measurements of some
kind for accounting for the effect of clouds on radiation. Although the
methods vary in their exact approach, the idea of all of them is to
utilize available observations to account for the parameters that affect
the amount of UV radiation reaching the surface. These parameters are,
most importantly, clouds, total ozone column, surface albedo,
atmospheric aerosols, and altitude or pressure. In addition, the solar
zenith angle determines the path length of the
[direct:rad]{acronym-label="direct:rad" acronym-form="singular+short"}
through the atmosphere and is therefore the single most important factor
for the surface UV radiation. The Earth-Sun distance, which varies over
the course of the year, also needs to be accounted for.

Many station-based methods for reconstructing the surface radiation were
included in recent European efforts to gain a better understanding of
past radiation and its climatological behaviour
[@kopke2006; @denouter2010]. Similar methods have been proposed and
applied in other parts of the world as well
[@fioletov2001; @fioletov2004]. Compared to satellite methods, the
advantage of the station-based methods is that they tend to give more
accurate estimates of the surface UV radiation. In particular, methods
using (300--3000 nm), measured by pyranometers at numerous stations
worldwide, as input for determining the cloud effect typically show
small bias and fairly small scatter when compared to measurements
[@kopke2006]. To mention one example, @lindfors2007 estimated daily
erythemal UV doses at four Nordic stations, and found a systematic
difference of between 0 and 4%, depending on the station, and a
root-mean-square error of 5--9% as compared to measurements for the
summer period.

Satellite methods are based on radiative transfer simulations combined
with information on, for example, clouds and total ozone column
retrieved from the satellite observations. Satellite retrieved UV
irradiances typically show an overestimation of 10% or more, and a large
scatter, when compared to surface measurements: the root-mean-square
errors for daily erythemal UV doses tends to be of the order of 30--40%
[@kujanpaa2010; @tanskanen2007; @lindfors2009b]. The main part of the
overestimation is usually attributed to aerosol absorption, which is not
accounted for properly in current satellite UV algorithms. The advantage
of satellite methods, on the other hand, is their large geographical
coverage, often global, and easy access to data that they provide.

Most methods, both station-based UV reconstruction methods and satellite
methods, only provide UV data corresponding to a selection of weighting
functions (e.g., erythemally weighted ), and, in addition, sometimes
irradiances for selected wavelengths. Furthermore, the methods typically
include only irradiances for a horizontal surface. This may become an
obstacle for biological applications where, for example, a specific
weighting function or spectral information would be preferred. In
principle, however, many of the methods could be extended to produce
spectral irradiances and fluence rates. On the other hand, fluence rates
can also be estimated based on the horizontal irradiance [e.g.,
@kylling2003].

Recently, @lindfors2009 presented a method for modelling spectral
surface irradiances. The method relies on radiative transfer
simulations, and takes as input (1) the effective cloud optical depth as
inferred from pyranometer measurements of
[global:rad]{acronym-label="global:rad" acronym-form="singular+short"};
(2) the total ozone column; (3) the surface albedo as estimated from
measurements of snow depth; (4) the total water vapour column; and (5)
the altitude of the location.
Figure [\[fig:jok2001\]](#fig:jok2001){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:jok2001"} shows a comparison between the daily
accumulated irradiances at 300 and 320 nm from this method and
measurements with a Brewer spectroradiometer at Jokioinen, southern
Finland. At both wavelengths, the reconstructed irradiances closely
follow the measured ones.

::: figure*
![image](figures/fig_uv_modelling.pdf)
:::

A variety of methods for modelling the surface UV radiation are
available. Which method is the best, or the most appropraite, depends on
the specific question that is to be answered. In general, the complexity
of the method tends to grow with increasing accuracy, and the
pyranometer-based UV reconstruction methods, that are considered to
provide highest accuracy, typically require an expert user. The use of
such a method will, however, increase cross-disciplinary collaboration
and may therefore be worthwhile.

::: example*
[]{#ex:effective:irradiance label="ex:effective:irradiance"} By
'biologically effective irradiance' we mean the irradiance weighted
according to the effectiveness of different wavelengths in eliciting a
photobiological response. The most frequently used biologically
effective irradiance quantities are photometric quantities such as those
described in Box
[\[box:photometric:quantities\]](#box:photometric:quantities){reference-type="ref"
reference="box:photometric:quantities"} on page . In the case of
photometric quantities the (energy) irradiance is weighted according to
the response of the human eye.

When studying the effects of radiation on plants we use as
[BSWFs]{acronym-label="BSWF" acronym-form="plural+short"} (BSWFs)
spectra describing the response of some plant function. For example an
action spectrum for accumulation of flavonoids, or an action spectrum
for growth inhibition. To be able to calculate biologically effective
irradiances using any BSWF, we need to measure the spectral irradiance
of the light source.

If we integrate the effective irradiance for the duration of an
experiment then we obtain a biologically effective exposure (usually
called 'biologically effective dose' by biologists). If we do the time
integration for one day we obtain a biologically effective daily
exposure.

These weighted irradiances are usually expressed using units
corresponding to the underlying energy irradiances, independently of the
BSWF used. Quantities calculated using different BSWFs are expressed in
the same units, but the values cannot be compared because in reality
they are measured on different scales.
:::

## BSWFs and effective UV doses {#sec:BSWFs:UVeff}

The emission spectrum of UV-B lamps, even filtered with acetate, is
different to that of the effect of ozone depletion. The spectrum of the
effect of ozone depletion not only changes with ozone column thickness,
but also with solar elevation. In other words, it changes through a day
and with seasons (Figure
[\[fig:lamp:solar:spectra\]](#fig:lamp:solar:spectra){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:lamp:solar:spectra"}). Because of this, it is almost
impossible to exactly simulate the effect of ozone depletion in field
experiments. The best we can do is to calculate effective doses.

::: figure*
![image](figures/fig4ab_lamp_solar.pdf)
:::

Biologically effective exposures (see Box
[\[ex:effective:irradiance\]](#ex:effective:irradiance){reference-type="ref"
reference="ex:effective:irradiance"}) are a way of measuring radiation
differing in spectral composition with the same 'measuring stick'. This
'measuring stick' is a biological response. Behind each measurement we
need to assume the involvement of a biological response. If we know the
action spectrum for the biological response, we can use it as a BSWF: We
multiply, wavelength by wavelength the spectral irradiance of the light
source by the BSWF obtaining a weighted spectrum, giving a
biologically-effective *spectral* irradiance (Figure
[\[fig:eff:spectral:irrad\]](#fig:eff:spectral:irrad){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:eff:spectral:irrad"}). We then integrate the result over
wavelengths, to obtain a single number, the biologically effective UV
irradiance[^26]. In Figure
[\[fig:eff:spectral:irrad\]](#fig:eff:spectral:irrad){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:eff:spectral:irrad"} it also possible to appreciate the
difference in relative change of this effective irradiance, for a given
level of ozone depletion, depending on the BSWF used.

It is important to make sure that both the irradiance and the
effectiveness are measured using compatible units. It is common to
express action spectra as spectral *quantum* effectiveness and to
measure light sources as spectral (*energy*) irradiance. In research,
biologically effective doses are most frequently expressed in weighted
energy units and to be able to calculate these doses from spectral
(energy) irradiance measurements for a light source (sunlight or lamps)
one needs to use an action spectrum expressed in energy effectiveness.
Most common formulations of action spectra need to be transformed from
quantum effectiveness to energy effectiveness (one important exception
is the CIE erythemal spectrum formulation). This is something that is
often neglected, and is a source of difficulties when comparing doses
between different publications.

Another possibility for measuring effective doses is to have a broadband
sensor with a spectral response resembling the action spectrum of
interest. In practice the spectral response of such sensors is only an
approximation to the desired and consequently need to be calibrated
under the light source to be measured, usually by comparison to a double
monochromator scanning spectroradiometer (see section
[9.7](#sec:spectroradiometers){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:spectroradiometers"} on page ). Most such sensors are
calibrated for sunlight, and consequently give biased readings when used
for measuring radiation from most lamps.

[]{#sec:RAF label="sec:RAF"}The [RAF]{acronym-label="RAF"
acronym-form="singular+short"} () gives the percent change in effective
dose () or, strictly speaking, effective exposure () for each percent
change in ozone column thickness. It should be calculated using
logarithms. $$\mathrm{RAF} = \frac{\ln \dose[d] - \ln \dose[n]}%
        {\ln [\Chem{O_3}]^\mathrm{n} - \ln [\Chem{O_3}]^\mathrm{d}}$$
where is dose and $[\Chem{O_3}]$ ozone concentration, and superscript
$\mathrm{d}$ indicates ozone depleted condition, and superscript
$\mathrm{n}$ indicates normal, or reference, ozone depth condition. The
value of depends strongly on the action spectrum used to calculate the
effective dose. Looking at
fig. [\[fig:eff:spectral:irrad\]](#fig:eff:spectral:irrad){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:eff:spectral:irrad"}, it can be understood why is much
larger for GEN than for PG.

### Weighting scales

Ultraviolet action spectra are usually normalized to quantum
effectiveness = 1 at 300 nm. This is arbitrary, and especially in the
older literature, you will find action spectra normalized at other
wavelengths. In the Materials and Methods section always report the
normalization used, in addition to the action spectrum used as a BSWF.
Remember that as the wavelength used for normalization is arbitrary,
values of effective UV doses calculated using the same BSWF but
normalized at different wavelengths cannot be directly compared because
they are expressed on different scales. Of course biologically effective
irradiances based on different BSWFs cannot be compared to each other
either.

Using the correct BSWF is very important, as using the wrong BSWF has
usually serious implications on the interpretation of experimental
results [@Caldwell2006; @Kotilainen2011].

### Comparing lamps and solar radiation

Frequently we want to compare UV doses in growth chambers to doses
outdoors. Unless we have a solar simulator the spectra will differ
significantly. It is especially important to keep the ratio similar to
that in solar radiation. Table
[\[tab:UVeff\]](#tab:UVeff){reference-type="ref" reference="tab:UVeff"}
gives an example comparing a frame with two acetate-filtered Q-Panel
UVB-313 lamps to sunlight with normal and 20% depleted ozone at
Jokioinen for 21 May at 11:30.

### Effective doses, enhancement errors and UV-B supplementation {#sec:enhancement:errors}

Ultraviolet-radiation supplementation can be modulated so as to follow
natural variation in solar UV or just follow a daily square wave pattern
(see section [8.2.6](#sec:modulated){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:modulated"} on page ). It is important that lamps are
filtered with cellulose di-acetate film (to remove UV-C radiation
emitted by UV-B lamps, which is absent in natural sunlight) and that
these filters are replaced regularly, specially in the case of square
wave systems, as modulated systems with feedback compensate for the
reduced dose automatically (although not for the change in spectrum)
[@Newsham1996a]. Even when adequately filtered the emission spectrum of
UV-B lamps does not match the effect of depletion (Figure
[\[fig:weighted:lamp:depl:GPAS:PG\]](#fig:weighted:lamp:depl:GPAS:PG){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:weighted:lamp:depl:GPAS:PG"}. We need to calculate
effective doses using BSWFs.

::: figure*
![image](figures/fig79_depl_lamp_eff.pdf)
:::

Errors caused by the mismatch between the doses aimed at and those
achieved when simulating the effect of ozone depletion with UV-B
enhancement with lamps are called enhancement errors. The main source of
these errors is the mismatch between the assumed spectral response and
the real spectral response. This is so because the adjustment of the
burning time (or power) of the UV-B lamps used for enhancement needs to
be based on biologically effective doses. However, depending on the
different BSWFs used, the needed lamp burning time may be long or short
(Figure
[\[fig:lamp:burning:times\]](#fig:lamp:burning:times){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:lamp:burning:times"}). Another way of looking at this
problem is to compare the deviation of the achieved when using a
'wrong'[^27] BSWF compared to the target one---e.g. corresponding to a
certain magnitude of ozone depletion. Figure
[\[fig:achieved:CIE\]](#fig:achieved:CIE){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:achieved:CIE"} shows this comparison for the frequent
case of use of a CIE-weighted broadband sensor to control the lamps used
in experiments with plants. The errors are surprisingly small for GEN
and PG.

::: figure*
![image](figures/lamps_figure.pdf)
:::

::: figure*
![image](figures/achieved_CIE_figure.pdf)
:::

An additional source of errors is shading by the lamp frames. If we do
not attempt to compensate for the shade with UV-B from the lamps the
error between PG and GEN is small [@Kotilainen2011]. How much the
effective UV dose decreases with shading does not depend on the BSWF
used as long as the shade is 'gray' (equally affects all relevant
wavelengths). However, how much UV from the lamps will be needed to
compensate for this will depend on the BSWF used (Table
[\[tab:shading:errors\]](#tab:shading:errors){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:shading:errors"}). With some BSWFs the lamp power or
burning time needed to compensate for shading is much more than that
needed to simulate ozone depletion, because with spectra like PG, we
need to replace shaded UV-A with UV-B from lamps. See section
[\[sec:RAF\]](#sec:RAF){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:RAF"} on
page for a discussion of the relationship between changes in ozone
column and changes in effective UV radiation.

To minimize shading errors we must build lamp frames that produce little
shade. Probably $<\!5$% shading is achievable. We should not attempt to
compensate for shading by the frames with UV from lamps. Shifting the
whole experiment's UV baseline dose by a small percentage but keeping
the size of enhancement at the target level is probably the best
approach available.

## Effective UV doses outdoors: seasonal and latitudinal variation

The state of the atmosphere (in terms of ozone column thickness,
cloudiness and aerosol content) together with day-length and daily
course of the solar zenith angle () are the main factors determining the
climatology of (and its components, and ) at ground level. For clear sky
conditions the average spatial and temporal distribution of UV
irradiance can be computed by means of a radiative transfer model fed
with proper and aerosol data [@Grifoni2008; @Grifoni2009]. In these
conditions the latitudinal and temporal distribution of irradiance are
driven mainly by two factors: day-length and through the day. See
section [9.9](#sec:modelling){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:modelling"} on page for a discussion of different
approaches to modelling.

To go from the climatology of spectral irradiance to that of the
biologically effective () exposures (or doses), spectral irradiance has
to be weighted to account for the different efficiency of each
wavelength in producing biological effects; this is done applying a
BSWF---based on the action spectrum of the biological process
considered. Plant action spectra differ in the weight given to and
radiation, as it has been illustrated in section
[7.8](#sec:action:spectra){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:action:spectra"} on page . In this analysis @Grifoni2009
considered two action spectra related to plant response: the so-called
Generalized Plant Action spectrum [GEN, proposed by @Caldwell1971] and
the more recent Plant Growth spectrum [PG, @Flint2003a]. The erythemal
action spectrum [CIE, @McKinlay1987] was also included since instruments
with a spectral sensibility quite close to it have been used in several
field experiments. The analysis presented in this section was based on
spectral global irradiance for cloud-free conditions on horizontal
surfaces simulated by means of the STAR model
[@Ruggaber1994; @Schwander2000] for Rome, Italy (lat. 41.88 N,
long. 12.47 E), Potsdam, Germany (lat. 52.40 N, long. 13.03 E) and
Trondheim, Norway (lat. 63.42 N, long. 10.42 E) on the first day of each
month of the year from 1:00 to 23:00 (UTC time) with a 30 min time step.
Daily doses () were calculated for all these 12 days.

After convoluting the spectral energy irradiances at ground level for
the three locations and seasons with the three BSWFs, a picture of the
seasonal of radiation was obtained, which was different depending on
latitude. The pattern of seasonal and latitudinal variation of the daily
doses is shown to depend strongly on the BSWF, and day of the year
(Table [\[tab:doses:seasons\]](#tab:doses:seasons){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:doses:seasons"}).

The changes in daily doses occurring through the year relative to the
yearly average, for the three locations across Europe illustrate the
effect of action spectra used as BSWFs (Figure
[\[fig:doses:seasonal\]](#fig:doses:seasonal){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:doses:seasonal"}).

::: figure*
![image](figures/fig_seasons.pdf)
:::

The largest seasonal variation occurs when the daily doses are computed
on the basis of action spectra completely or partially excluding the
contribution of the component, as in the case of GEN and CIE
respectively. Figure
[\[fig:doses:seasonal\]](#fig:doses:seasonal){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:doses:seasonal"} shows the extent to which latitude
affects these seasonal changes, which have a larger amplitude as the
latitude increases. In other words, the climatology of appears to be
strongly dependent on the action spectrum used, and, as different plant
responses follow different action spectra, the effective climatology
will depend on the plant response under study.

These differences in climatology are ecologically relevant, for instance
for perennial species that may experience different seasonal change in
the irradiance they are exposed to, depending on the latitude at which
they are growing and on the biological process/action spectrum studied.

## Effective UV doses in controlled environments

If the light spectrum in a controlled environment differs greatly from
that under natural conditions, the relative biologically effective
irradiances will differ greatly depending on the action spectrum used as
. For example, if irradiance is much lower in daylight than in the
controlled environment, but irradiance similar to that in daylight, the
dose calculated using GEN(G) as a BSWF will differ little between the
controlled environment and daylight, but the dose based on PG will be
much lower in the controlled environment than in daylight. This example
shows why we need to use a realistic light spectrum in controlled
environments when we want to extrapolate the results from such
experiments to natural conditions. Furthermore, an increased ratio
between and radiation, and/or radiation and artificially enhances the
responses of plants to radiation.

## An accuracy ranking of quantification methods

Table
[\[tab:methods:accuracy\]](#tab:methods:accuracy){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:methods:accuracy"} shows a preliminary comparison of
different methods available for quantifying solar UV radiation and
estimating biologically effective doses. Bias is the systematic
directional deviation from the true value, for example overestimation of
irradiance or doses. Uncertainty is a random deviation that prevents us
from knowing the true value, but deviations are not systematic
---measurements from different instruments or the same instruments after
different recalibrations will deviate by different amounts and in
different directions from the true value.

A detailed comparison is difficult with the information currently
available, consequently some gaps remain in the table. However, some
general recommendations are possible. For outdoors experiments with
manipulation of solar , the best option is most probably a combination
of (a) hourly simulation of UV spectral irradiance with a model using
ground station data as input, plus (b) spot measurements, for example
under different filters with a spectroradiometer under clear sky
conditions. It is best to replace modelling (a) with actual continuous
measurements with a well calibrated double monochromator
spectroradiometer. However, this is rarely possible in practice, as
there are few ground stations producing validated spectral data.

For experiments using lamps, the best option from the point of view of
accuracy is the use of a double monochromator spectroradiometer. From a
practical viewpoint, using a broadband instrument calibrated against a
double monochromator spectroradiometer, may be easier. When measuring
mixed daylight and lamp radiation, or mixed radiation from diverse
lamps, or when there is degradation of filters, broadband instruments
are totally unsuitable.

Single monochromator spectroradiometers should be avoided for
measurements of radiation when there is a background of or visible
radiation, unless very special handling of stray light is done by a
combination of special measuring protocols and data processing.

## Sanity checks for data and calculations {#sec:sanity:quantifying}

When quantifying radiation, or in fact when doing any measurement, one
should compare the values (e.g. irradiances or daily doses) against what
has earlier been reported in the literature for a similar light source.
In this way many errors can be detected. To help in this process we
present in Table
[\[tab:typical:irrad:values\]](#tab:typical:irrad:values){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:typical:irrad:values"} typical values for both unweighted
and (energy) irradiance, photon irradiance, and biologically effective
irradiances with the most frequently used BSWFs and wavelength
normalisations. For radiation outdoors one can use a model (e.g. TUV
quick simulator) to estimate spectral irradiance values and from them
calculate effective doses or exposure. We have done these calculations
for some sites, and present them in Table
[\[tab:typical:irrad:values\]](#tab:typical:irrad:values){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:typical:irrad:values"}. We have also included data for
some lamps.

[11.12](#sec:recommend:stat){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:recommend:stat"} for recommendations about statistical
design of experiments.

1.  Always report in your publications the radiation effective exposure
    (frequently called effective doses in the biological literature),
    depending on the type of experiment, as daily integrated values or
    effective irradiances plus daily exposure time. Calculate effective
    doses using relevant action spectra and if possible report doses
    using all the most commonly used ones: CIE, GEN(G), and PG.

2.  Always indicate the name of the quantity measured, the type of
    sensor and its position during measurement, location of sensor with
    reference to plants, and unit of measurement. In the case of
    effective doses, indicate how they were calculated, in particular,
    cite the bibliographic source for the action spectrum and
    formulation used, and at which wavelength the spectrum was
    normalized to effectiveness equal to unity.

3.  Whenever possible include in your publications the emission spectrum
    of the light source and/or transmittance spectrum of the filters
    used, or cite an earlier paper where the spectra have already been
    published.

4.  Use only instruments with recent and valid calibration data for the
    measurements at hand.

5.  Make sure, in the case of broadband sensors, that the calibration is
    valid for the light source being measured. For example, broadband
    sensors calibrated for sunlight should **not** be used for measuring
    irradiance under lamps.

6.  If high precision is required in the measurements, apply all the
    necessary corrections. This is important both for broadband and
    spectral measurements.

7.  Be aware of temperature effects on the functioning of the meter and
    sensor used and apply the required corrections or use temperature
    stabilized instruments.

8.  Single monochromator array or scanning spectrometers can be used for
    measuring effective exposures in sunlight only with very serious
    limitations and only if complicated corrections are applied to the
    raw data to take into account stray light and the properties of the
    slit function. These corrections are not possible with the software
    provided by the makers of the instruments. Uncorrected measurements
    from this type of instruments are subject to huge uncertainties and,
    what is worse, bias. Use double monochromator spectroradiometers
    instead.

9.  When using spectrometers configured with SMA connectors for optical
    fibres, do not detach the fibre at the spectrometer end[^28][^29].
    Doing so invalidates the calibration because the alignment of the
    fibre with respect to the entrance slit may be different after the
    fibre is reattached.

10. When measuring, take into account the field of view of the entrance
    optics of your instrument (e.g. one hemisphere for a cosine
    corrected irradiance sensor) and make sure that yourself and any
    other nearby objects do not disturb the radiation 'seen' by the
    instrument.

11. Take into account that spot measurements of in sunlight under
    different filters describe only one point in time. Continuous
    measurements or modelling based on continuous ground-based
    measurements are needed to fully describe the treatments applied.

12. Outdoor irradiance is affected by cloudiness, so measurements where
    a single instrument is moved to take sequential measurements under
    the different treatments should be avoided unless the sky is
    perfectly clear. In addition, parallel measurement of PAR or global
    radiation in the open is recommended so as to be able to detect any
    variation due to clouds.

13. exposure values (also called doses) derived from satellite-based
    measurements are subject to relatively large errors and bias, so it
    is better to avoid their use, specially when daily or weekly values
    are needed. Much of the uncertainty derives from the sparse nature
    of the satellite data (e.g. one or fewer fly overs per day).

14. Routinely check your instruments. Frequently check that the readings
    are very close to zero when the sensor is in darkness. Do sanity
    checks on your data against values expected (e.g. using models or
    published data). For example if when measuring a sunlight spectrum
    you get spectral irradiance values different from zero[^30] at
    wavelengths shorter than 290 nm you can be sure that there is a
    problem. There may be too much stray light, or a bad correction for
    the dark signal, or simply the spectrometer is not good enough for
    the job.

15. When measuring sunlight or lamp spectra for calculating effective
    doses you need a spectroradiometer with a spectral resolution of at
    least 1 nm. Furthermore to reduce noise use only averaging of
    repeated scans rather than 'Boxcar smoothing'. Boxcar smoothing
    reduces the spectral resolution by doing a moving average across
    wavelengths.

## Appendix: Formulations for action spectra used as BSWFs {#app:formulations}

The calculation of biologically effective UV doses requires weighting
the spectral energy irradiance () or spectral photon irradiance () at
each wavelength with a weighting value that is typically generated from
a mathematical formulation fitted to describe the weighting function or
action spectrum of the biological process---i.e. a
[BSWF]{acronym-label="BSWF" acronym-form="singular+short"} (BSWF). Data
obtained from a spectroradiometer are usually provided as spectral
energy irradiance (units: ) and care should be taken to use the
appropriate formulation that uses either energy effectiveness () or
quantum effectiveness () values as appropriate.

The usual approach is to base effective UV doses on energy irradiance
data, using BSWFs that provide values for relative energy effectiveness
at each wavelength. However, BSWFs are often defined using quantum
effectiveness for application to photon irradiance values. Consequently,
conversion of energy irradiance values measured during experiments to
photon irradiance is necessary before applying weighting functions
originally formulated using quantum effectiveness. Conversion of energy
irradiance values to photon irradiance can be achieved using equation
[\[eq:photon\]](#eq:photon){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:photon"}
on page . After conversion, the calculated effective doses will be on a
different scale than if they are calculated based on energy irradiance
values. Note that you may find examples in the literature where
formulations based on quantum effectiveness () have been inappropriately
applied to spectral energy exposure (unit: ) or spectral energy
irradiance (unit: ).

The general plant action spectrum of Caldwell (Code GEN in Table
[\[tab:action:spectra\]](#tab:action:spectra){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:action:spectra"} on page ) was originally published
simply as a graphical figure of quantum effectiveness against wavelength
[@Caldwell1971] and subsequently two publications have fitted different
mathematical formulations to describe its use as a weighting function.
@Green1974 fitted a function that decreases to zero at 313 nm whereas an
alternative mathematical fit provided by @Thimijan1978 continues to
weight irradiance values up to 345 nm in the region. Both of these
functions are shown on Figure
[\[fig:action:spectra\]](#fig:action:spectra){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:action:spectra"} on page as GEN(G) and GEN(T)
respectively. It is important to specify which mathematical function has
been used when describing the calculation of effective UV doses in
experimental methods.

The general plant action spectrum of Caldwell fitted with the
mathematical function of @Green1974 is given by [Source: @Bjorn1993a]:

$$\qeff[GEN(G)](\lambda) = \begin{cases}
           2.618 \cdot \left[ 1-\left(\frac{\lambda}{313.3}\right)^2 \right] \cdot %\cr
\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{\lambda-300}{31.08}} & \text{if $\lambda\le313.3$ nm}\\
0 & \text{if $\lambda>313.3$ nm}
\end{cases} \label{eq:GEN.G}$$

and when fitted with the mathematical function of @Thimijan1978 is given
by [Source: @Bjorn1993a]:

$$\qeff[GEN(T)](\lambda) = \begin{cases}
\mathrm{e}^{-\left(\frac{265-\lambda}{21}\right)^2} & \text{if $\lambda\le345$ nm}\\
0 & \text{if $\lambda>345$ nm}
\end{cases} \label{eq:GEN.T}$$

The DNA damage formulation of @Green1975 is given by:

$$%\qeff[DNA(GM)](\lambda) & = & \exp\left\{ 13.82 \cdot \left[ \left( 1+\exp\left( \frac{\lambda-310}{9} \right)\right)^{-1} -1 \right] \right\} \label{eq:DNA.GM}
\qeff[DNA(GM)](\lambda) = \mathrm{e}^{ 13.82 \cdot \left[ \left( 1+\mathrm{e}^{ \frac{\lambda-310}{9}} \right)^{-1} -1 \right] } \label{eq:DNA.GM}$$

The doses calculated with this formulation differ significantly from
doses calculated using tabulated values derived from the figure in
@Setlow1974. For example the model TUV and the data from the NSF
monitoring network use the tabulated values rather than the formulation
by @Green1975.

However, most BSWFs are conventionally used with a value of one at 300
nm. This may be achieved by simple calculation adjustments within a
spreadsheet (by dividing each wavelength effectiveness by the
effectiveness value at 300 nm) or by altering the mathematical formula
directly. Thus, the mathematical formulation of @Green1974 for GEN(G)
requires equation [\[eq:GEN.G\]](#eq:GEN.G){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:GEN.G"} to be multiplied by 4.596 to normalize it to a
value of 1 at 300nm and similarly GEN(T) requires equation
[\[eq:GEN.T\]](#eq:GEN.T){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:GEN.T"} to
be multiplied by 16.083 and DNA(GM) requires equation
[\[eq:DNA.GM\]](#eq:DNA.GM){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:DNA.GM"}
to be multiplied by 30.675.

The formulation of the weighting function published by @Flint2003a for
plant growth, shown as PG in Figure
[\[fig:action:spectra\]](#fig:action:spectra){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:action:spectra"} on page , was for quantum effectiveness
and already provides normalization to 1 at 300 nm and is given by:

$$%\qeff[PG](\lambda) & = & \cases{\mathrm{e}^{4.688272\ \cdot
% \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{e}^{0.1703411 \cdot \frac{\lambda-307.867}{1.15} +
%\left(\frac{390-\lambda}{121.7557}-4.183832\right)}}} & if $\lambda\le390$ nm\cr
%0 & if $\lambda>390$ nm\cr} \label{eq:PG}
\qeff[PG](\lambda) =  \begin{cases}\exp\left(4.688272\ \cdot \right. \cr
\left.
\ \ \ \exp\left(-\exp\left(0.1703411 \cdot \frac{\lambda-307.867}{1.15}\right)\right) + \right. %\cr
\left.
\left(\frac{390-\lambda}{121.7557}-4.183832\right)\right) & \text{if $\lambda\le390$ nm}\\
0 & \text{if $\lambda>390$ nm}
\end{cases}
 \label{eq:PG}$$

Some weighting functions are already defined using energy effectiveness
values for use with energy irradiance data, one example being the CIE
erythemal action spectrum [@McKinlay1987; @Webb2011]. The standard was
revised in 1998 and the updated version should be used instead of the
original one from 1987 [@Webb2011]. It is important to check that
published mathematical formulae have been appropriately normalized to
one at 300 nm. However, whereas most BSWFs are conventionally set to one
at 300 nm, the CIE98 erythemal weighting function has defined values at
specific wavelengths [@Webb2011] and is given by:

$$\eeff[CIE](\lambda) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if $250\le\lambda\le298$ nm}\\
10^{0.094(298-\lambda)} & \text{if $298\le\lambda\le328$ nm}\\
10^{0.015(140-\lambda)} & \text{if $328\le\lambda\le400$ nm}\\
0 & \text{if $\lambda > 400$}
\end{cases} \label{eq:CIE}$$

Weighting functions defined using quantum effectiveness (), and
normalized to one at 300 nm, can be converted to relative energy
effectiveness () simply by multiplication, wavelength by wavelength, of
the quantum effectiveness by by the respective wavelength in nm and
dividing by 300 (the chosen normalization wavelength in nm). The value
300 should be changed when using other wavelengths for normalization.
This is based on equation
[\[eq:photon\]](#eq:photon){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:photon"}
giving the energy in one photon, but as Planck's constant ($h$) and the
speed of light in vacuum ($c$) are constant divisors, and we are
expressing the effectiveness in relative units, they can be left out of
the calculation.

It is always essential to specify clearly the normalization wavelength,
the mathematical formulation and the BSWF used when describing the
calculation of effective UV doses.

## Appendix: Calculation of effective doses with Excel {#app:Excel}

Let us start with a text file generated by a spectroradiometer and its
connected computer. With the instruments that I have used this text file
consists of one column, containing either spectral (energy) irradiance
or spectral photon irradiance (some instruments, especially for
underwater use, may have fluence rate instead of irradiance). At the
start, above the columns, is a heading containing supplementary
information. Other instruments may have two columns, the first one
containing wavelength values, the other one spectral irradiance values.

For the Optronics instruments that I have used, the start of a data file
looks like the listing in Figure
[\[fig:list:Optronics\]](#fig:list:Optronics){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:list:Optronics"}. The heading here contains "a", which in
this case is the name of the file, the kind of data that is recorded
(including the unit), the date, the starting wavelength in nm, the end
wavelength (not shown here) in nm, and the step interval in nm. This
file can be loaded into an Excel file going to
`Data`$>$`Get external data`$>$`Load text file`. When you have done
this, insert a new column to the left of the one containing the measured
data. In this new column you should fill in the wavelength values, which
can be done in the following way without typing every value:

:::: figure*
::: footnotesize
    "a","Irradiance [W/(cm^2 nm)]",971217,250.00,400.00,1.00
    1.439562E-010
    1.797497E-010
    6.126532E-010
    4.516362E-009
    8.027722E-009
    1.081851E-009
    2.862175E-010
    1.728253E-010
    1.790998E-010
    1.953554E-010
    2.570309E-010
    ...
:::
::::

Type the first two values, i.e. in this case first "250" in the cell
left of the one containing the first radiation value 1.439562E-010.
Since the step interval is 1.00 nm, the next value is 251. Type this in
the cell to the left of the value 1.797497E-010. Select the two cells
that you have just filled in. Put the cursor at the lower left corner of
the cell containing "251" and see it change appearance, push the (left)
mouse button and drag down to the cell left of the last radiation value.
The column will then fill up with the appropriate wavelength values.

You have now filled columns A and B with the appropriate values. Next
you should generate a column with values of the weighting function.
Suppose you wish to use the weighting function of @Flint2003a. The
formula given for this in the publication is Biologically effective UV=
$\exp[4.688272*\exp(- \exp(0.1703411*(x-307.867)/1.15))+((390-x)/121.7557-4.183832)]$
in which $x$ stands for wavelength in nm.

Select cells in column C over the rows corresponding to values in
columns A and B. Go to "Tools" on top of the file, push the mouse button
and go down and select "Calculator". Type the formula above, with the
exceptions that you use ordinary parentheses instead of square brackets,
"A:A" instead of "x" (do not type the quotation marks), and comma
instead of dot if you use the comma system. When this is done, press OK
and save the result.

You now have the values of the weighting function in column C. If you
double-click on the first value in column C you should get the equation
entered. The top of your file should then look like Figure
[\[fig:Excel:sheet\]](#fig:Excel:sheet){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Excel:sheet"}. If you insert a new column C to the left
of your old column C and copy the wavelength values into it you can plot
your weighting function as a check. If you plot it on a logarithmic
abscissa, it should look something like Figure
[\[fig:Excel:PG\]](#fig:Excel:PG){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Excel:PG"}. This can be compared to the plot in the
original publication by @Flint2003a. Once you have generated a weighting
function that you wish to use several times, you need of course not
calculate it like this every time. You can simply transfer the column
with it to a new sheet or a new Excel file. Since, as newly generated,
it depends on another column, you need to use the command "Paste
special" and choose "values".

::: figure*
![image](screen/Excel_LOB_Weighting_of_a_spectrum1.pdf){width="0.7\\myfigwidth"}
:::

::: figure*
![image](screen/Excel_LOB_PG.jpg){width="0.7\\myfigwidth"}
:::

Now you are ready to do the weighting itself. Select cells in column E
in rows corresponding to the values in the other columns. Select the
Calculator, and use it to multiply values in column B with the weighting
function. Select an empty cell and go a final time to the Calculator.
Select "Sum" and then the values you have just generated in column E.
The sum you get in the cell you selected is the weighted radiation
value. The number is, in this case, 0.000334759 and the unit is W
cm$^{-2}$, which can also be expressed as 3.35 . The bottom of the file
should look like Figure
[\[fig:Excel:sheet:bottom\]](#fig:Excel:sheet:bottom){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Excel:sheet:bottom"}. I have written $\Sigma$ in one cell
to remember that the value to the right of it is the sum of the values
above it.

::: figure*
![image](screen/Excel_LOB_sheet_bottom.jpg){width="0.75\\myfigwidth"}
:::

Note that if you have another step size than 1 nm, you must multiply the
sum by that step size. It is recommended that you do not use step sizes
greater than 1 nm for UV-B spectra, since both the spectra themselves
and the weighting functions are so steep.

Martyn Caldwell's traditional Generalized Plant Action Spectrum is
easier to handle, and you should be able now to do a similar exercise
with it yourself. A formula for this weighting function has been
published by @Green1974: Weighting function
$= 2.618\cdot[1 -( \lambda/313.3)2]\cdot \exp[-(\lambda - 300)/31.08],$
where $\lambda$ stands for wavelength in nm. We abbreviate the name of
this action spectrum as GEN(G) elsewhere in this text. See section
[9.17](#app:formulations){reference-type="ref"
reference="app:formulations"} on page for the equations for other
commonly used BSWFs.

## Appendix: Calculation of effective doses with R {#app:R}

### Introduction {#introduction}

If you use the R system for statistics (see,
<http://www.r-project.org/>), or if you need an implementation with
fewer restrictions, you may want to use R instead of Excel to calculate
doses and action spectra. R is based on a real programming language
called S and allows much flexibility. We have developed a package to
facilitate these calculations. The package is called 'UVcalc' and will
be soon submitted to CRAN (Comprehensive R archive network) and will be
available also from this handbook's web page. In addition to functions
for calculating weighted and unweighted doses, and irradiance and from
energy irradiance spectra, also functions for calculating photon ratios
are provided.

### Calculating doses

Currently functions for five are implemented and are listed in Table
[\[tab:R:dose:functions\]](#tab:R:dose:functions){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:R:dose:functions"}. The functions take two arguments one
vector giving the wavelengths and another vector giving the values of
spectral energy irradiance at these wavelengths. The spectral irradiance
or spectral exposure values would come either from measurements with a
spectroradiometer or from model simulations. All functions accept a
wavelengths vector with variable and arbitrary step sizes, with the
condition that the wavelengths are sorted in strictly increasing order,
something which is especially convenient when dealing with data from
array spectrometers[^31].

The functions are made available by installing the package `UVcalc`
(once) and loading it from the library when needed. To load the package
into the workspace use `library(UVcalc)`. Then load your spectral data
into R using `read.table()` or `read.csv()`.

A file from a Macam spectroradiometer starts:

``` {lastline="20"}
Wavelength(nm),W/m2
270,0
271,0
272,1.17E-04
273,2.42E-04
274,4.55E-04
275,8.94E-04
276,0.00161
277,0.00263
278,0.00412
279,0.00621
280,0.00904
281,0.01697
282,0.02069
283,0.02663
284,0.03314
285,0.04075
286,0.04895
287,0.05817
288,0.0679
```

For a file like this one, use the code below but replacing \"name\" with
the name and path to the data file. On Windows systems you need to scape
backslashes in file paths like this: '`\\`'.

![image](listings/uvcalc_lst1.pdf){width="\\linewidth"}

If our spectral irradiance data is in , and the wavelength in nm, as in
the case of the Macam spectroradiometer, the functions will return the
effective irradiance in .

If, for example, the spectral irradiance output by our model or
spectroradiometer is in m, and the wavelengths are in Ångstrom then to
obtain the effective irradiance in we will need to convert the units.

![image](listings/uvcalc_lst2.pdf){width="\\linewidth"}

In this example, we take advantage of the behaviour of the S language:
an operation between a scalar and vector, is equivalent to applying this
operation to each member of the vector. Consequently, in the code above,
each value from the vector of wavelengths is divided by 10, and each
value in the vector of spectral irradiances is divided by 1000.

If the spectral irradiance is in then values should be multiplied by 10
to convert them to .

It is very important to make sure that the wavelengths are in nanometers
as this is what the functions expect. If the wavelengths are in the
wrong units, the BSWF will be wrongly calculated, and the returned value
for effective irradiance will be wrong.

If we use as input to the functions instead of spectral irradiances,
time-integrated spectral irradiances in , then the functions will return
the effective exposure, or 'dose' in . Such time-integrated values are
more frequently available as the output of models, or by integrating
observed sequential values of spectral irradiance.

In addition to the functions for calculating biologically effective
doses and effective irradiances, we provide functions for calculating
unweighted doses or irradiances of (`PPFD()` or `PAR.q.dose()`, and
`PAR.e.dose()`), (`UVA.q.dose()` and `UVA.e.dose()`) and (`UVB.q.dose()`
and `UVB.e.dose()`), where 'e' variants return energy doses, and 'q'
variants return quantum or photon doses. All functions expect as input
radiation spectra in energy units, and wavelengths in nm.

### Calculating an action spectrum at given wavelengths

The functions available for calculating action spectra take as argument
a vector of wavelengths, and return a vector of effectiveness (either
quantum=photon or energy based) normalized to unity effectiveness at a
wavelength of 300 nm except when indicated. These functions are listed
in Table
[\[tab:R:action:spectra:functions\]](#tab:R:action:spectra:functions){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:R:action:spectra:functions"}, and an example of their use
follows. In these examples we generate the wavelengths vectors in R, but
they can be also read from a file.

![image](listings/uvcalc_lst3.pdf){width="\\linewidth"}

All functions accept a wavelengths vector with variable and arbitrary
step sizes, with the condition that the wavelengths are sorted in
strictly increasing order.

### Calculating photon ratios {#app:R:ratios:photon}

Functions are also provided for calculating photon ratios between
different pairs of wavebands. These functions are listed in Table
[\[tab:R:photon:ratios:functions\]](#tab:R:photon:ratios:functions){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:R:photon:ratios:functions"}. We follow the most
frequently used wavelength ranges for the different colours, but also
provide some generic functions that can be used when other limits are
needed. Continuing with the example above in which my.data was read and
attached we calculate UV-B : PAR photon ratio

![image](listings/uvcalc_lst4.pdf){width="\\linewidth"}

The spectral energy irradiance, can be in any energy based unit such as
, or , as the multipliers cancel out when calculating the ratio.
However, wavelengths must be always expressed in nanometers. Please, be
aware that these functions will return erroneous values if used with
spectra expressed as spectral photon irradiance, even though the
returned values are photon ratios.

Please, be aware that following common practice in the literature, the
wavelength range used for red light is different for the different
photon ratios.

### Documentation

The package includes manual pages for the different functions, and an
overview and a list of references for the original sources used. The
definition of the functions can bee seen once the package is loaded by
entering the name of the function without parameters or parentheses.

There are many resources on the R-System for Statistics and statistics
in general available on-line. The most useful ones are The R Wiki
(<http://rwiki.sciviews.org/>), and the documentation included in all R
installations and accompanying each one of the different packages.

Some classical books on R are those by @Dalgaard2002, @Crawley2005
[@Crawley2007], and @Venables2002. The book by [@Venables2000] discusses
programming in S, the language used in R to build new functions and
packages.
