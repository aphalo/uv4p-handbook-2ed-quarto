The instrument takes advantage of a feedback loop that equalizes the fluorescence level induced by a reference red light to the UV-light-induced fluorescence level. This allows quick measurement from attached leaves even under field conditions. The use of light-emitting diodes and of a leaf-clip configuration makes Dualex a user-friendly instrument with potential applications in ecophysiological research, light climate analysis, agriculture, forestry, horticulture, pest management, selection of medicinal plants, and wherever accumulation of leaf polyphenolics is involved in plant responses to the environment.},

  abstract  = {Quercus robur L. saplings were exposed in an outdoor experiment to supplemental levels of UV-B (280-315 nm) radiation using treatment arrays of cellulose diacetate-filtered fluorescent lamps that also produce UV-A (315-400 nm) radiation. Saplings were also exposed to UV-A radiation alone using control arrays of the same lamps filtered with polyester and to ambient levels of radiation, using arrays of unenergized lamps. The UV-B treatment was modulated to maintain a 30\% elevation above the ambient level of UV-B radiation, measured by a broad-band sensor weighted with an erythemal action spectrum. Saplings exposed to UV-B radiation beneath treatment arrays developed thicker leaves than those beneath ambient and control arrays. Despite the fact that supplemental levels of UV-A radiation were only a small percentage of ambient levels, apparent UV-A effects were also recorded. Significant increases in sapling height, lammas shoot length and herbivory by chewing insects were observed under treatment and control arrays, relative to ambient, but there were no differences between the responses of saplings under treatment and control. These data imply that supplemental UV-A radiation or other effects associated with energised lamps can significantly affect plant growth parameters and herbivory in outdoor studies. We conclude that the results from current outdoor UV-B supplementation experiments that lack control exposures using polyester-filtered lamps need to be interpreted with caution and that future supplementation experiments should include appropriate controls.

  abstract  = {The role of photosynthetically active radiation (400-700 nm) (PAR) in modifying plant sensitivity and photomorphogenic responses to ultraviolet-B (280-320 nm) (UV-B) radiation has been examined by a number of investigators, but few studies have been conducted on ultraviolet-A (320-400 nm) (UV-A), UV-B and PAR interactions. High ratios of PAR-UV-B and UV-A-UV-B have been found to be important in ameliorating UV-B damage in both terrestrial and aquatic plants. Growth chamber and greenhouse studies conducted at low PAR, low UV-A and high UV-B often show exaggerated UV-B damage. Spectral balance of PAR, UV-A and UV-B has also been shown to be important in determining plant sensitivity in field studies. In general, one observes a reduction in total biomass and plant height with decreasing PAR and increasing UV-B. The protective effects of high PAR against elevated UV-B may also be indirect, by increasing leaf thickness and the concentration of flavonoids and other phenolic compounds known to be important in UV screening. The quality of PAR is also important, with blue light, together with UV-A radiation, playing a key role in photorepair of DNA lesions. Further studies are needed to determine the interactions of UV-A, UV-B and PAR.},

  abstract  = {Wavelengths in the ultraviolet {(UV)} region of the solar spectrum, {UV-B} (280-315 nm) and {UV-A} (315-400 nm) are key environmental signals modifying several aspects of plant physiology. Despite significant advances in the understanding of plant responses to {UV-B} and the identification of signaling components involved, there is limited information on the molecular mechanisms that control {UV-B} signaling in plants under natural sunlight. Here, we aimed to corroborate the previous suggested role for {RADICAL-INDUCED} {CELL} {DEATH1} {(RCD1)} in {UV-B} signaling under full spectrum sunlight. Wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana and the rcd1-1 mutant were used in an experimental design outdoors where {UV-B} and {UV-A} irradiances were manipulated using plastic films, and gene expression, {PYRIDOXINE} {BIOSYNTHESIS} 1 {(PDX1)} accumulation and metabolite profiles were analysed in the leaves. At the level of transcription, {RCD1} was not directly involved in the solar {UV-B-regulation} of genes with functions in {UV} acclimation, hormone signaling and stress related markers. Furthermore, {RCD1} had no role on {PDX1} accumulation but modulated the {UV-B-induction} of flavonoid accumulation in leaves of Arabidopsis exposed to solar {UV.} We conclude that {RCD1} does not play an active role in {UV-B} signaling but rather modulates {UV-B} responses under full spectrum sunlight.},
